       STATUS       current
       DESCRIPTION
               "This data type is used as the syntax of the ifType
               object in the (updated) definition of MIB-II's
               ifTable.

               The definition of this textual convention with the
               addition of newly assigned values is published
               periodically by the IANA, in either the Assigned
               Numbers RFC, or some derivative of it specific to
               Internet Network Management number assignments.  (The
               latest arrangements can be obtained by contacting the
               IANA.)

               Requests for new values should be made to IANA via
               email (iana@iana.org).

               The relationship between the assignment of ifType
               values and of OIDs to particular media-specific MIBs
               is solely the purview of IANA and is subject to change
               without notice.  Quite often, a media-specific MIB's
               OID-subtree assignment within MIB-II's 'transmission'
               subtree will be the same as its ifType value.
               However, in some circumstances this will not be the
               case, and implementors must not pre-assume any
               specific relationship between ifType values and
               transmission subtree OIDs."

PhysicalClass ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

    DESCRIPTION
            "An enumerated value which provides an indication of the
            general hardware type of a particular physical entity.
            There are no restrictions as to the number of
            entPhysicalEntries of each entPhysicalClass, which must be
            instantiated by an agent.

            The enumeration 'other' is applicable if the physical entity
            class is known, but does not match any of the supported
            values.

            The enumeration 'unknown' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is unknown to the agent.

            The enumeration 'chassis' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is an overall container for networking
            equipment.  Any class of physical entity except a stack may
            be contained within a chassis, and a chassis may only be
            contained within a stack.

            The enumeration 'backplane' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is some sort of device for aggregating and
            forwarding networking traffic, such as a shared backplane in
            a modular ethernet switch.  Note that an agent may model a


            backplane as a single physical entity, which is actually
            implemented as multiple discrete physical components (within
            a chassis or stack).

            The enumeration 'container' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is capable of containing one or more removable
            physical entities, possibly of different types. For example,
            each (empty or full) slot in a chassis will be modeled as a
            container. Note that all removable physical entities should
            be modeled within a container entity, such as field-
            replaceable modules, fans, or power supplies.  Note that all
            known containers should be modeled by the agent, including
            empty containers.

            The enumeration 'powerSupply' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is a power-supplying component.

            The enumeration 'fan' is applicable if the physical entity
            class is a fan or other heat-reduction component.

            The enumeration 'sensor' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is some sort of sensor, such as a temperature
            sensor within a router chassis.

            The enumeration 'module' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is some sort of self-contained sub-system.  If
            it is removable, then it should be modeled within a
            container entity, otherwise it should be modeled directly
            within another physical entity (e.g., a chassis or another
            module).

            The enumeration 'port' is applicable if the physical entity
            class is some sort of networking port, capable of receiving
            and/or transmitting networking traffic.

            The enumeration 'stack' is applicable if the physical entity
            class is some sort of super-container (possibly virtual),
            intended to group together multiple chassis entities.  A
            stack may be realized by a 'virtual' cable, a real
            interconnect cable, attached to multiple chassis, or may in
            fact be comprised of multiple interconnect cables. A stack
            should not be modeled within any other physical entities,
            but a stack may be contained within another stack.  Only
            chassis entities should be contained within a stack."

    DESCRIPTION
            "An indication of the relative position of this 'child'
            component among all its 'sibling' components. Sibling
            components are defined as entPhysicalEntries which share the
            same instance values of each of the entPhysicalContainedIn
            and entPhysicalClass objects.

            An NMS can use this object to identify the relative ordering
            for all sibling components of a particular parent
            (identified by the entPhysicalContainedIn instance in each
            sibling entry).

            This value should match any external labeling of the
            physical component if possible. For example, for a container
            (e.g., card slot) labeled as 'slot #3',
            entPhysicalParentRelPos should have the value '3'.  Note
            that the entPhysicalEntry for the module plugged in slot 3
            should have an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '1'.

            If the physical position of this component does not match
            any external numbering or clearly visible ordering, then
            user documentation or other external reference material
            should be used to determine the parent-relative position. If
            this is not possible, then the the agent should assign a
            consistent (but possibly arbitrary) ordering to a given set
            of 'sibling' components, perhaps based on internal
            representation of the components.

            If the agent cannot determine the parent-relative position
            for some reason, or if the associated value of
            entPhysicalContainedIn is '0', then the value '-1' is
            returned. Otherwise a non-negative integer is returned,
            indicating the parent-relative position of this physical
            entity.

            Parent-relative ordering normally starts from '1' and
            continues to 'N', where 'N' represents the highest
            positioned child entity.  However, if the physical entities
            (e.g., slots) are labeled from a starting position of zero,


            then the first sibling should be associated with a
            entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '0'.  Note that this
            ordering may be sparse or dense, depending on agent
            implementation.

            The actual values returned are not globally meaningful, as
            each 'parent' component may use different numbering
            algorithms. The ordering is only meaningful among siblings
            of the same parent component.

            The agent should retain parent-relative position values
            across reboots, either through algorithmic assignment or use
            of non-volatile storage."

            A compliant SNMP agent may wish to conserve naming scopes by
            representing multiple logical entities in a single 'default'

            represented by the same value of entLogicalCommunity have no
            object instances in common.  For example, 'bridge1' and
            'repeater1' may be part of the main naming scope, but at
            least one additional community string is needed to represent
            'bridge2' and 'repeater2'.

            Logical entities 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' would be
            represented by sysOREntries associated with the 'default'

            physical resources which are used to realize that logical
            entity.

            An agent should limit the number and nature of entries in
            this table such that only meaningful and non-redundant
            information is returned. For example, in a system which
            contains a single power supply, mappings between logical
            entities and the power supply are not useful and should not
            be included.

            Also, only the most appropriate physical component which is
            closest to the root of a particular containment tree should
            be identified in an entLPMapping entry.

            For example, suppose a bridge is realized on a particular
            module, and all ports on that module are ports on this
            bridge. A mapping between the bridge and the module would be

            was utilizing ports on this module, then mappings between

entConfigChange NOTIFICATION-TYPE
    STATUS             current
    DESCRIPTION
            "An entConfigChange notification is generated when the value
            of entLastChangeTime changes. It can be utilized by an NMS
            to trigger logical/physical entity table maintenance polls.

            An agent should not generate more than one entConfigChange
            'notification-event' in a given time interval (five seconds
            is the suggested default).  A 'notification-event' is the
            transmission of a single trap or inform PDU to a list of
            notification destinations.

            If additional configuration changes occur within the
            throttling period, then notification-events for these
            changes should be suppressed by the agent until the current
            throttling period expires.  At the end of a throttling
            period, one notification-event should be generated if any
            configuration changes occurred since the start of the
            throttling period. In such a case, another throttling period
            is started right away.

            An NMS should periodically check the value of
            entLastChangeTime to detect any missed entConfigChange
            notification-events, e.g., due to throttling or transmission
            loss."

    DESCRIPTION
            "An object using this data type represents a sensor
            precision range.

            An object of this type SHOULD be defined together with
            objects of type EntitySensorDataType and
            EntitySensorDataScale.  Together, associated objects of
            these three types are used to identify the semantics of an
            object of type EntitySensorValue.

            If an object of this type contains a value in the range 1 to
            9, it represents the number of decimal places in the
            fractional part of an associated EntitySensorValue fixed-
            point number.

            If an object of this type contains a value in the range -8
            to -1, it represents the number of accurate digits in the
            associated EntitySensorValue fixed-point number.

            The value zero indicates the associated EntitySensorValue
            object is not a fixed-point number.

            Agent implementors must choose a value for the associated
            EntitySensorPrecision object so that the precision and


            accuracy of the associated EntitySensorValue object is
            correctly indicated.

            For example, a physical entity representing a temperature
            sensor that can measure 0 degrees to 100 degrees C in 0.1
            degree increments, +/- 0.05 degrees, would have an
            EntitySensorPrecision value of '1', an EntitySensorDataScale
            value of 'units(9)', and an EntitySensorValue ranging from
            '0' to '1000'.  The EntitySensorValue would be interpreted
            as 'degrees C * 10'."

            The semantics of an object using this data type are

            indicates an underflow error. The value +1000000000
            indicates an overflow error.  The EntitySensorPrecision
            indicates how many fractional digits are represented in the
            associated EntitySensorValue object.

            If the associated EntitySensorDataType object is equal to
            'percentRH(9)', then an object of this type MUST contain a
            number ranging from 0 to 100.

            If the associated EntitySensorDataType object is equal to
            'rpm(10)', then an object of this type MUST contain a number

ifTestTable   OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX      SEQUENCE OF IfTestEntry
    MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
    STATUS      deprecated
    DESCRIPTION
            "This table contains one entry per interface.  It defines
            objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent
            to test an interface for various faults.  Tests for an
            interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that
            interface.  After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult
            can be read to determine the outcome.  If an agent can not
            perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate.  The
            object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test-
            specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific)
            information concerning the outcome of the test.  Only one
            test can be in progress on each interface at any one time.
            If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the
            second test is rejected.  Some agents may reject a test when
            a prior test is active on another interface.

            Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain
            'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the
            interface to be tested.  This is accomplished with the
            ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows:

          try_again:
              get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)
              while (ifTestStatus != notInUse)
                  /*
                   * Loop while a test is running or some other
                   * manager is configuring a test.
                   */
                  short delay
                  get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)
              }

              /*
               * Is not being used right now -- let's compete
               * to see who gets it.
               */
              lock_value = ifTestId

              if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse,


                       ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE)
                  /*
                   * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go
                   * try again
                   */
                  goto try_again;

              /*
               * I have the lock
               */
              set up any test parameters.

              /*
               * This starts the test
               */
              set(ifTestType = test_to_run);

              wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult

              when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult
                   agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse'

              retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId

              if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid

            A manager station first retrieves the value of the
            appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically
            repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of
            ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'.  The manager station then tries
            to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just
            retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the
            corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating
            itself.  If the set operation succeeds then the manager has
            obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the
            ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the
            semantics of TestAndIncr).  Failure of the set operation
            indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of
            the ifTestEntry.

            Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be
            setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType.
            On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to
            'notInUse'.  Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the
            results.  In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests
            by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be
            a possibility that the first test's results might be
            overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first


            results being read.  This unlikely circumstance can be
            detected by a network manager retrieving ifTestId at the
            same time as retrieving the test results, and ensuring that
            the results are for the desired request.

            If ifTestType is not set within an abnormally long period of
            time after ownership is obtained, the agent should time-out
            the manager, and reset the value of the ifTestStatus object
            back to 'notInUse'.  It is suggested that this time-out
            period be 5 minutes.

            In general, a management station must not retransmit a
            request to invoke a test for which it does not receive a
            response; instead, it properly inspects an agent's MIB to
            determine if the invocation was successful.  Only if the
            invocation was unsuccessful, is the invocation request
            retransmitted.

            Some tests may require the interface to be taken off-line in
            order to execute them, or may even require the agent to
            reboot after completion of the test.  In these
            circumstances, communication with the management station
            invoking the test may be lost until after completion of the
            test.  An agent is not required to support such tests.
            However, if such tests are supported, then the agent should
            make every effort to transmit a response to the request
            which invoked the test prior to losing communication.  When
            the agent is restored to normal service, the results of the
            test are properly made available in the appropriate objects.
            Note that this requires that the ifIndex value assigned to
            an interface must be unchanged even if the test causes a
            reboot.  An agent must reject any test for which it cannot,
            perhaps due to resource constraints, make available at least
            the minimum amount of information after that test
            completes."

          DESCRIPTION
           "An entry in the VPL table.  This entry is
            used to model a bi-directional VPL.
            To create a VPL at an ATM interface,
            either of the following procedures are used:

            Negotiated VPL establishment

          (1) The management application creates
              a VPL entry in the atmVplTable
              by setting atmVplRowStatus to createAndWait(5).
              This may fail for the following reasons:
              - The selected VPI value is unavailable,
              - The selected VPI value is in use.
              Otherwise, the agent creates a row and
              reserves the VPI value on that port.

          (2) The manager selects an existing row(s) in the
              atmTrafficDescrParamTable,
              thereby, selecting a set of self-consistent
              ATM traffic parameters and the service category
              for receive and transmit directions of the VPL.

         (2a) If no suitable row(s) in the
              atmTrafficDescrParamTable exists,
              the manager must create a new row(s)
              in that table.

         (2b) The manager characterizes the VPL's traffic
              parameters through setting the
              atmVplReceiveTrafficDescrIndex and the


              atmVplTransmitTrafficDescrIndex values
              in the VPL table, which point to the rows
              containing desired ATM traffic parameter values
              in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable.  The agent
              will check the availability of resources and
              may refuse the request.
              If the transmit and receive service categories
              are inconsistent, the agent should refuse the
              request.

          (3) The manager activates the VPL by setting the
              the atmVplRowStatus to active(1).
              If this set is successful, the agent has
              reserved the resources to satisfy the requested
              traffic parameter values and the service category
              for that VPL.

          (4) If the VPL terminates a VPC in the ATM host
              or switch, the manager turns on the
              atmVplAdminStatus to up(1) to turn the VPL
              traffic flow on.  Otherwise, the
              atmVpCrossConnectTable  must be used
              to cross-connect the VPL to another VPL(s)
              in an ATM switch or network.

            One-Shot VPL Establishment

            A VPL may also be established in one step by a
            set-request with all necessary VPL parameter
            values and atmVplRowStatus set to createAndGo(4).

            In contrast to the negotiated VPL establishment
            which allows for detailed error checking
            (i.e., set errors are explicitly linked to
            particular resource acquisition failures),
            the one-shot VPL establishment
            performs the setup on one operation but
            does not have the advantage of step-wise
            error checking.

            VPL Retirement

            A VPL is released by setting atmVplRowStatus to
            destroy(6), and the agent may release all
            associated resources."

              may refuse the request.
              If the transmit and receive service categories
              are inconsistent, the agent should refuse the
              request.

          (3) The manager activates the VCL by setting the
              the atmVclRowStatus to active(1) (for
              requirements on this activation see the
              description of atmVclRowStatus).
              If this set is successful, the agent has
              reserved the resources to satisfy the requested
              traffic parameter values and the service category
              for that VCL.
          (4) If the VCL terminates a VCC in the ATM host
              or switch, the manager turns on the
              atmVclAdminStatus to up(1) to turn the VCL
              traffic flow on.  Otherwise, the
              atmVcCrossConnectTable  must be used
              to cross-connect the VCL to another VCL(s)
              in an ATM switch or network.

           One-Shot VCL Establishment

           A VCL may also be established in one step by a
           set-request with all necessary VCL parameter
           values and atmVclRowStatus set to createAndGo(4).

           In contrast to the negotiated VCL establishment
           which allows for detailed error checking
           (i.e., set errors are explicitly linked to
           particular resource acquisition failures),
           the one-shot VCL establishment
           performs the setup on one operation but
           does not have the advantage of step-wise
           error checking.


           VCL Retirement

           A VCL is released by setting atmVclRowStatus to
           destroy(6), and the agent may release all
           associated resources."

               two ends of that cross-connection.
               This set of rows specifies the topology of the
               VPC cross-connect and is identified by a single
               value of atmVpCrossConnectIndex.

            Negotiated VP Cross-Connect Establishment

          (2a) The manager creates a row in this table by
               setting atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus to
               createAndWait(5).  The agent checks the
               requested topology and the mutual sanity of
               the ATM traffic parameters and
               service categories, i.e., the row creation
               fails if:
               - the requested topology is incompatible with
                 associated values of atmVplCastType,
               - the requested topology is not supported
                 by the agent,
               - the traffic/service category parameter values
                 associated with the requested row are
                 incompatible with those of already existing
                 rows for this VP cross-connect.
               [For example, for setting up
               a point-to-point VP cross-connect, the
               ATM traffic parameters in the receive direction


               of a VPL at the low end of the cross-connect
               must equal to the traffic parameters in the
               transmit direction of the other VPL at the
               high end of the cross-connect,
               otherwise, the row creation fails.]
               The agent also checks for internal errors
               in building the cross-connect.

               The atmVpCrossConnectIndex values in the
               corresponding atmVplTable rows are filled
               in by the agent at this point.

          (2b) The manager promotes the row in the
               atmVpCrossConnectTable by setting
               atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus to active(1).  If
               this set is successful, the agent has reserved
               the resources specified by the ATM traffic
               parameter and Service category values
               for each direction of the VP cross-connect
               in an ATM switch or network.

           (3) The manager sets the
               atmVpCrossConnectAdminStatus to up(1) in all
               rows of this VP cross-connect to turn the
               traffic flow on.

            One-Shot VP Cross-Connect Establishment

            A VP cross-connect may also be established in
            one step by a set-request with all necessary
            parameter values and atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus
            set to createAndGo(4).

            In contrast to the negotiated VP cross-connect
            establishment which allows for detailed error
            checking (i.e., set errors are explicitly linked
            to particular resource acquisition failures),
            the one-shot VP cross-connect establishment
            performs the setup on one operation but does not
            have the advantage of step-wise error checking.

            VP Cross-Connect Retirement

            A VP cross-connect identified by a particular
            value of atmVpCrossConnectIndex is released by:

           (1) Setting atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus of all


               rows identified by this value of
               atmVpCrossConnectIndex to destroy(6).
               The agent may release all
               associated resources, and the
               atmVpCrossConnectIndex values in the
               corresponding atmVplTable row are removed.
               Note that a situation when only a subset of
               the associated rows are deleted corresponds
               to a VP topology change.

           (2) After deletion of the appropriate
               atmVpCrossConnectEntries, the manager may
               set atmVplRowStatus to destroy(6) the
               associated VPLs.  The agent releases
               the resources and removes the associated
               rows in the atmVplTable.

            VP Cross-connect Reconfiguration

            At the discretion of the agent, a VP
            cross-connect may be reconfigured by
            adding and/or deleting leafs to/from
            the VP topology as per the VP cross-connect
            establishment/retirement procedures.
            Reconfiguration of traffic/service category parameter
            values requires release of the VP cross-connect
            before those parameter values may by changed
            for individual VPLs."

               Note that a situation when only a subset of

            VC Cross-Connect Reconfiguration

            At the discretion of the agent, a VC
            cross-connect may be reconfigured by
            adding and/or deleting leafs to/from
            the VC topology as per the VC cross-connect
            establishment/retirement procedures.
            Reconfiguration of traffic/service category parameter
            values requires release of the VC cross-connect
            before those parameter values may by changed
            for individual VCLs."

          "This MIB is for use in managing host systems. The term
          `host' is construed to mean any computer that communicates
          with other similar computers attached to the internet and
          that is directly used by one or more human beings. Although
          this MIB does not necessarily apply to devices whose primary
          function is communications services (e.g., terminal servers,
          routers, bridges, monitoring equipment), such relevance is
          not explicitly precluded.  This MIB instruments attributes
          common to all internet hosts including, for example, both
          personal computers and systems that run variants of Unix."

          experience.  This revision was also reformatted in the SMIv2
          format. The revisions made were:

          New RFC document standards:
             Added Copyright notice, updated introduction to SNMP
             Framework, updated references section, added reference to
             RFC 2119, and added a meaningful Security Considerations
             section.

          New IANA considerations section for registration of new types

          Conversion to new SMIv2 syntax for the following types and
          macros:
              Counter32, Integer32, Gauge32, MODULE-IDENTITY,

           hardware or software product.  It is suggested that
           these OBJECT IDENTIFIERs are allocated such that all
           products from a particular manufacturer are registered
           under a subtree distinct to that manufacturer.  In
           addition, all versions of a product should be
           registered under a subtree distinct to that product.
           With this strategy, a management station may uniquely
           determine the manufacturer and/or model of a product
           whose productID is unknown to the management station.
           Objects of this type may be useful for inventory
           purposes or for automatically detecting
           incompatibilities or version mismatches between
           various hardware and software components on a system.

           For example, the product ID for the ACME 4860 66MHz

           An entry shall be placed in the storage table for each
           logical area of storage that is allocated and has
           fixed resource limits.  The amount of storage
           represented in an entity is the amount actually usable
           by the requesting entity, and excludes loss due to
           formatting or file system reference information.

           These entries are associated with logical storage
           areas, as might be seen by an application, rather than
           physical storage entities which are typically seen by
           an operating system.  Storage such as tapes and
           floppies without file systems on them are typically
           not allocated in chunks by the operating system to
           requesting applications, and therefore shouldn't
           appear in this table.  Examples of valid storage for
           this table include disk partitions, file systems, ram
           (for some architectures this is further segmented into
           regular memory, extended memory, and so on), backing
           store for virtual memory (`swap space').

           This table is intended to be a useful diagnostic for
           `out of memory' and `out of buffers' types of
           failures.  In addition, it can be a useful performance

-- VCL TPs, etc. can be derived from the instance values of the
-- objects included in the notifications.  As examples, the ifIndex
-- value for an interface can be derived from the ifOperStatus
-- instance value, whereas the entPhysicalIndex value can be derived
-- from any of the entPhysicalContainedIn, entPhysicalParentRelPos,
-- and entPhysicalClass instance values.

                    attached to this interface, the value of this

                    If auto-negotiation is implemented and enabled
                    for the MAU attached to this interface, the

                    denotes the mode to which the interface will
                    automatically revert if/when auto-negotiation is
                    later disabled.  Note that when auto-negotiation
                    is running, administrative control of the PAUSE

                      support setting the value of this object to some
                      of the enumerated values.

                      The value other(1) is returned if the MAU is in
                      a state other than one of the states 2 through
                      6.


                      The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
                      true state is unknown; for example, when it is
                      being initialized.

                      A MAU in the operational(3) state is fully
                      functional, operates, and passes signals to its
                      attached DTE or repeater port in accordance to
                      its specification.

                      A MAU in standby(4) state forces DI and CI to
                      idle and the media transmitter to idle or fault,
                      if supported.  Standby(4) mode only applies to
                      link type MAUs.  The state of
                      rpMauMediaAvailable is unaffected.

                      A MAU in shutdown(5) state assumes the same
                      condition on DI, CI, and the media transmitter
                      as though it were powered down or not connected.
                      The MAU MAY return other(1) value for the
                      rpMauJabberState and rpMauMediaAvailable objects
                      when it is in this state.  For an AUI, this
                      state will remove power from the AUI.

                      Setting this variable to the value reset(6)
                      resets the MAU in the same manner as a
                      power-off, power-on cycle of at least one-half
                      second would.  The agent is not required to
                      return the value reset (6).

                      Setting this variable to the value
                      operational(3), standby(4), or shutdown(5)
                      causes the MAU to assume the respective state
                      except that setting a mixing-type MAU or an AUI
                      to standby(4) will cause the MAU to enter the

          DESCRIPTION "If the MAU is a link or fiber type (FOIRL,
                      10BASE-T, 10BASE-F) then this is equivalent to
                      the link test fail state/low light function.
                      For an AUI or a coax (including broadband) MAU
                      this indicates whether or not loopback is
                      detected on the DI circuit.  The value of this
                      attribute persists between packets for MAU types
                      AUI, 10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BROAD36, and 10BASE-FP.

                      The value other(1) is returned if the
                      mediaAvailable state is not one of 2 through 11.

                      The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
                      true state is unknown; for example, when it is
                      being initialized.  At power-up or following a
                      reset, the value of this attribute will be
                      unknown for AUI, coax, and 10BASE-FP MAUs.  For
                      these MAUs loopback will be tested on each
                      transmission during which no collision is
                      detected.  If DI is receiving input when DO
                      returns to IDL after a transmission and there
                      has been no collision during the transmission
                      then loopback will be detected.  The value of
                      this attribute will only change during
                      non-collided transmissions for AUI, coax, and
                      10BASE-FP MAUs.

                      For 100Mbps and 1000Mbps MAUs, the enumerations
                      match the states within the respective link
                      integrity state diagrams, fig 32-16, 23-12 and
                      24-15 of sections 32, 23 and 24 of [16].  Any
                      MAU which implements management of
                      auto-negotiation will map remote fault
                      indication to remote fault.

                      The value available(3) indicates that the link,
                      light, or loopback is normal.  The value
                      notAvailable(4) indicates link loss, low light,
                      or no loopback.


                      The value remoteFault(5) indicates that a fault
                      has been detected at the remote end of the link.
                      This value applies to 10BASE-FB, 100BASE-T4 Far
                      End Fault Indication and non-specified remote
                      faults from a system running auto-negotiation.
                      The values remoteJabber(7), remoteLinkLoss(8),
                      and remoteTest(9) SHOULD be used instead of
                      remoteFault(5) where the reason for remote fault
                      is identified in the remote signaling protocol.

                      The value invalidSignal(6) indicates that an
                      invalid signal has been received from the other
                      end of the link.  InvalidSignal(6) applies only
                      to MAUs of type 10BASE-FB.

                      Where an IEEE Std 802.3u-1995 clause 22 MII
                      is present, a logic one in the remote fault bit
                      (reference section 22.2.4.2.8 of that document)
                      maps to the value remoteFault(5), and a logic
                      zero in the link status bit (reference section
                      22.2.4.2.10 of that document) maps to the value
                      notAvailable(4).  The value notAvailable(4)
                      takes precedence over the value remoteFault(5).

                      Any MAU that implements management of clause 37
                      Auto-Negotiation will map the received Remote
                      Fault (RF1 and RF2) bit values for Offline to
                      offline(10), Link Failure to remoteFault(5) and

                      this attribute will only change during
                      non-collided transmissions for AUI, coax, and
                      10BASE-FP MAUs.

                      For 100Mbps and 1000Mbps MAUs, the enumerations
                      match the states within the respective link
                      integrity state diagrams, fig 32-16, 23-12 and
                      24-15 of sections 32, 23 and 24 of [16].  Any
                      MAU which implements management of
                      auto-negotiation will map remote fault
                      indication to remote fault.

                      The value available(3) indicates that the link,
                      light, or loopback is normal.  The value
                      notAvailable(4) indicates link loss, low light,
                      or no loopback.

                      The value remoteFault(5) indicates that a fault
                      has been detected at the remote end of the link.
                      This value applies to 10BASE-FB, 100BASE-T4 Far
                      End Fault Indication and non-specified remote
                      faults from a system running auto-negotiation.


                      The values remoteJabber(7), remoteLinkLoss(8),
                      and remoteTest(9) SHOULD be used instead of
                      remoteFault(5) where the reason for remote fault
                      is identified in the remote signaling protocol.

                      The value invalidSignal(6) indicates that an
                      invalid signal has been received from the other
                      end of the link.  InvalidSignal(6) applies only
                      to MAUs of type 10BASE-FB.

                      Where an IEEE Std 802.3u-1995 clause 22 MII
                      is present, a logic one in the remote fault bit
                      (reference section 22.2.4.2.8 of that document)
                      maps to the value remoteFault(5), and a logic
                      zero in the link status bit (reference section
                      22.2.4.2.10 of that document) maps to the value
                      notAvailable(4).  The value notAvailable(4)
                      takes precedence over the value remoteFault(5).

                      Any MAU that implements management of clause 37
                      Auto-Negotiation will map the received RF1 and
                      RF2 bit values for Offline to offline(10), Link
                      Failure to remoteFault(5) and Auto-Negotiation

DESCRIPTION
    "The MIB module defining objects for the management of a pair of
    ADSL modems at each end of the ADSL line.  Each such line has

    an entry in an ifTable which may include multiple modem lines.
    An agent may reside at either end of the ADSL line however the
    MIB is designed to require no management communication between
    them beyond that inherent in the low-level ADSL line protocol.
    The agent may monitor and control this protocol for its needs.

    ADSL lines may support optional Fast or Interleaved channels.
    If these are supported, additional entries corresponding to the
    supported channels must be created in the ifTable. Thus an ADSL
    line that supports both channels will have three entries in the
    ifTable, one for each physical, fast, and interleaved, whose
    ifType values are equal to adsl(94), fast(125), and
    interleaved(124), respectively. The ifStackTable is used to
    represent the relationship between the entries.

    Naming Conventions:
              Atuc -- (ATUC) modem at near (Central) end of line
              Atur -- (ATUR) modem at Remote end of line

                  associated channels (when applicable) for cases
                  when it is configured in dual mode, and operating
                  in a G.Lite-type mode as denoted by
                  adslLineTransAtucActual.  Dual mode exists when the
                  object, adslLineTransAtucConfig, is configured with
                  one or more full-rate modes and one or more G.Lite
                  modes simultaneously.

                  When 'dynamic' profiles are implemented, the value
                  of object is equal to the index of the applicable
                  row in the ADSL Line Configuration Profile Table,
                  AdslLineConfProfileTable defined in ADSL-MIB
                  [RFC2662].

                  In the case when dual-mode has not been enabled,
                  the value of the object will be equal to the value
                  of the object adslLineConfProfile [RFC2662].

                  When `static' profiles are implemented, in much
                  like the case of the object,
                  adslLineConfProfileName [RFC2662], this object's
                  value will need to algorithmically represent the
                  characteristics of the line.  In this case, the
                  value of the line's ifIndex plus a value indicating
                  the line mode type (e.g., G.Lite, Full-rate) will
                  be used. Therefore, the profile's name is a string
                  concatenating the ifIndex and one of the follow
                  values: Full or Lite. This string will be
                  fixed-length (i.e., 14) with leading zero(s).  For
                  example, the profile name for ifIndex that equals
                  '15' and is a full rate line, it will be
                  '0000000015Full'."

-- Several objects in this MIB module represent values of
-- timers used by the Spanning Tree Protocol.  In this
-- MIB, these timers have values in units of hundreths of
-- a second (i.e. 1/100 secs).
-- These timers, when stored in a Spanning Tree Protocol's
-- BPDU, are in units of 1/256 seconds.  Note, however,
-- that 802.1D-1990 specifies a settable granularity of
-- no more than 1 second for these timers.  To avoid
-- ambiguity, a data type is defined here as a textual
-- convention and all representation of these timers
-- in this MIB module are defined using this data type.  An
-- algorithm is also defined for converting between the
-- different units, to ensure a timer's value is not
-- distorted by multiple conversions.
-- The data type is:

Timeout ::= INTEGER -- a STP timer in units of 1/100 seconds

-- To convert a Timeout value into a value in units of
-- 1/256 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:
--
--      b  = floor( (n * 256) / 100)
--
-- where:
--      floor   =  quotient [ignore remainder]
--      n is the value in 1/100 second units
--      b is the value in 1/256 second units
--
-- To convert the value from 1/256 second units back to
-- 1/100 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:
--
--      n = ceiling( (b * 100) / 256)
--
-- where:
--      ceiling =  quotient [if remainder is 0], or
--                 quotient + 1 [if remainder is non-zero]
--      n is the value in 1/100 second units
--      b is the value in 1/256 second units
--
-- Note: it is important that the arithmetic operations are
-- done in the order specified (i.e., multiply first, divide

    DESCRIPTION
            "The newRoot trap indicates that the sending agent
            has become the new root of the Spanning Tree; the
            trap is sent by a bridge soon after its election
            as the new root, e.g., upon expiration of the
            Topology Change Timer immediately subsequent to
            its election.  Implementation of this trap is
            optional."

            Learning state to the Forwarding state, or from
            the Forwarding state to the Blocking state.  The
            trap is not sent if a newRoot trap is sent for the
            same transition.  Implementation of this trap is
            optional."

     DESCRIPTION
         "Bug fixes, clarifications and minor changes based on
         implementation experience, published as RFC1757 [18].

         Two changes were made to object definitions:

         1) A new status bit has been defined for the
         captureBufferPacketStatus object, indicating that the
         packet order within the capture buffer may not be identical to
         the packet order as received off the wire.  This bit may only


         be used for packets transmitted by the probe.  Older NMS
         applications can safely ignore this status bit, which might be
         used by newer agents.

         2) The packetMatch trap has been removed.  This trap was never
         actually 'approved' and was not added to this document along
         with the risingAlarm and fallingAlarm traps. The packetMatch
         trap could not be throttled, which could cause disruption of
         normal network traffic under some circumstances. An NMS should
         configure a risingAlarm threshold on the appropriate
         channelMatches instance if a trap is desired for a packetMatch
         event. Note that logging of packetMatch events is still
         supported--only trap generation for such events has been
         removed.

         In addition, several clarifications to individual object
         definitions have been added to assist agent and NMS
         implementors:

         - global definition of 'good packets' and 'bad packets'

         - more detailed text governing conceptual row creation and
           modification

         - instructions for probes relating to interface changes and
           disruptions

         - clarification of some ethernet counter definitions

         - recommended formula for calculating network utilization

         - clarification of channel and captureBuffer behavior for some
           unusual conditions

         - examples of proper instance naming for each table"

         values composed of well-formed UTF-8 sequences.

         It is suggested that this name contain one or more of
         the following: IP address, management station name,

         In some cases the agent itself will be the owner of

         SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms
         of the contents of MIB views; access to a particular
         SNMP object instance depends only upon its presence
         or absence in a particular MIB view and never upon
         its value or the value of related object instances.
         Thus, objects of this type afford resolution of
         resource contention only among cooperating
         managers; they realize no access control function
         with respect to uncooperative parties."

 EntryStatus ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
     STATUS current
     DESCRIPTION
         "The status of a table entry.

         Setting this object to the value invalid(4) has the
         effect of invalidating the corresponding entry.
         That is, it effectively disassociates the mapping
         identified with said entry.
         It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether
         the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table.
         Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to
         receive tabular information from agents that corresponds
         to entries currently not in use.  Proper
         interpretation of such entries requires examination
         of the relevant EntryStatus object.

         An existing instance of this object cannot be set to
         createRequest(2).  This object may only be set to
         createRequest(2) when this instance is created.  When
         this object is created, the agent may wish to create
         supplemental object instances with default values
         to complete a conceptual row in this table.  Because the


         creation of these default objects is entirely at the option
         of the agent, the manager must not assume that any will be
         created, but may make use of any that are created.
         Immediately after completing the create operation, the agent
         must set this object to underCreation(3).

         When in the underCreation(3) state, an entry is allowed to
         exist in a possibly incomplete, possibly inconsistent state,
         usually to allow it to be modified in multiple PDUs.  When in
         this state, an entry is not fully active.
         Entries shall exist in the underCreation(3) state until
         the management station is finished configuring the entry
         and sets this object to valid(1) or aborts, setting this
         object to invalid(4).  If the agent determines that an
         entry has been in the underCreation(3) state for an
         abnormally long time, it may decide that the management
         station has crashed.  If the agent makes this decision,
         it may set this object to invalid(4) to reclaim the
         entry.  A prudent agent will understand that the
         management station may need to wait for human input
         and will allow for that possibility in its
         determination of this abnormally long period.

         An entry in the valid(1) state is fully configured and
         consistent and fully represents the configuration or
         operation such a row is intended to represent.  For
         example, it could be a statistical function that is
         configured and active, or a filter that is available

         A manager is restricted to changing the state of an entry in
         the following ways:

              To:       valid  createRequest  underCreation  invalid
         From:
         valid             OK             NO             OK       OK
         createRequest    N/A            N/A            N/A      N/A
         underCreation     OK             NO             OK       OK
         invalid           NO             NO             NO       OK
         nonExistent       NO             OK             NO       OK

         In the table above, it is not applicable to move the state
         from the createRequest state to any other state because the
         manager will never find the variable in that state.  The
         nonExistent state is not a value of the enumeration, rather
         it means that the entryStatus variable does not exist at all.


         An agent may allow an entryStatus variable to change state in
         additional ways, so long as the semantics of the states are
         followed.  This allowance is made to ease the implementation of
         the agent and is made despite the fact that managers should
         never exercise these additional state transitions."

         In order to identify a particular interface, this object
         shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object,
         defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface.
         For example, if an entry were to receive data from
         interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1.

         The statistics in this group reflect all packets

         differences in the sampled values are Pkts and Octets,
         respectively, and the number of seconds in the interval is
         Interval.  These values are used to calculate the Utilization

         The value returned will depend on the location of the

         10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a
         station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if
         three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously.  A
         repeater port must detect a collision when two or more


         stations are transmitting simultaneously.  Thus a probe
         placed on a repeater port could record more collisions
         than a probe connected to a station on the same segment
         would.

         Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering
         10BASE-T.  14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3
         defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals
         on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving
         at the same time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect
         collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes placed on
         a station and a repeater, should report the same number of
         collisions.

         Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should
         ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or
         more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE
         802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax

 -- Once samples are taken, their data is stored in an entry

 -- If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start

 -- when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is
 -- started at that instant.  This tends to make more

         The value returned will depend on the location of the

         10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a
         station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if
         three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously.  A

         placed on a repeater port could record more collisions
         than a probe connected to a station on the same segment
         would.

         Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering
         10BASE-T.  14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3
         defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals
         on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving
         at the same time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect
         collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes placed on
         a station and a repeater, should report the same number of
         collisions.

         Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should
         ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or
         more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE
         802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax

 -- The Alarm group periodically takes statistical samples from

 -- been configured.  The alarm table stores configuration
 -- entries that each define a variable, polling period, and
 -- threshold parameters.  If a sample is found to cross the

 -- The Host Group

 -- Implementation of the Host group is optional.
 -- Consult the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro for the authoritative
 -- conformance information for this MIB.
 --
 -- The host group discovers new hosts on the network by
 -- keeping a list of source and destination MAC Addresses seen
 -- in good packets.  For each of these addresses, the host group


 -- keeps a set of statistics.  The hostControlTable controls
 -- which interfaces this function is performed on, and contains
 -- some information about the process.  On behalf of each
 -- hostControlEntry, data is collected on an interface and placed
 -- in both the hostTable and the hostTimeTable.  If the
 -- monitoring device finds itself short of resources, it may
 -- delete entries as needed.  It is suggested that the device
 -- delete the least recently used entries first.

 -- The hostTable contains entries for each address discovered on
 -- a particular interface.  Each entry contains statistical
 -- data about that host.  This table is indexed by the
 -- MAC address of the host, through which a random access
 -- may be achieved.

 -- The hostTimeTable contains data in the same format as the
 -- hostTable, and must contain the same set of hosts, but is
 -- indexed using hostTimeCreationOrder rather than hostAddress.
 -- The hostTimeCreationOrder is an integer which reflects
 -- the relative order in which a particular entry was discovered
 -- and thus inserted into the table.  As this order, and thus
 -- the index, is among those entries currently in the table,
 -- the index for a particular entry may change if an
 -- (earlier) entry is deleted.  Thus the association between
 -- hostTimeCreationOrder and hostTimeEntry may be broken at
 -- any time.

 -- The hostTimeTable has two important uses.  The first is the
 -- fast download of this potentially large table.  Because the
 -- index of this table runs from 1 to the size of the table,
 -- inclusive, its values are predictable.  This allows very
 -- efficient packing of variables into SNMP PDU's and allows
 -- a table transfer to have multiple packets outstanding.
 -- These benefits increase transfer rates tremendously.

 -- The second use of the hostTimeTable is the efficient discovery
 -- by the management station of new entries added to the table.
 -- After the management station has downloaded the entire table,
 -- it knows that new entries will be added immediately after the
 -- end of the current table.  It can thus detect new entries there
 -- and retrieve them easily.

 -- Because the association between hostTimeCreationOrder and
 -- hostTimeEntry may be broken at any time, the management
 -- station must monitor the related hostControlLastDeleteTime
 -- object.  When the management station thus detects a deletion,
 -- it must assume that any such associations have been broken,
 -- and invalidate any it has stored locally.  This includes


 -- restarting any download of the hostTimeTable that may have been
 -- in progress, as well as rediscovering the end of the
 -- hostTimeTable so that it may detect new entries.  If the
 -- management station does not detect the broken association,
 -- it may continue to refer to a particular host by its
 -- creationOrder while unwittingly retrieving the data associated
 -- with another host entirely.  If this happens while downloading
 -- the host table, the management station may fail to download
 -- all of the entries in the table.

 -- The Filter Group

 -- Implementation of the Filter group is optional.


 -- Consult the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro for the authoritative
 -- conformance information for this MIB.
 --
 -- The Filter group allows packets to be captured with an
 -- arbitrary filter expression.  A logical data and
 -- event stream or "channel" is formed by the packets
 -- that match the filter expression.
 --
 -- This filter mechanism allows the creation of an arbitrary
 -- logical expression with which to filter packets.  Each
 -- filter associated with a channel is OR'ed with the others.
 -- Within a filter, any bits checked in the data and status are
 -- AND'ed with respect to other bits in the same filter.  The
 -- NotMask also allows for checking for inequality.  Finally,
 -- the channelAcceptType object allows for inversion of the
 -- whole equation.
 --
 -- If a management station wishes to receive a trap to alert it
 -- that new packets have been captured and are available for
 -- download, it is recommended that it set up an alarm entry that
 -- monitors the value of the relevant channelMatches instance.
 --
 -- The channel can be turned on or off, and can also
 -- generate events when packets pass through it.

         The only bits relevant to this match algorithm are those that

         The following two rules are then applied to every packet:

         (1) For each relevant bit from the packet status with the
             corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to zero, if
             the bit from the packet status is not equal to the


             corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the
             packet will fail this status match.

         (2) If for every relevant bit from the packet status with the
             corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to one, the
             bit from the packet status is equal to the corresponding
             bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail
             this status match.

         Any packets that have not failed either of the two matches
         above have passed this status match.  In particular, a zero
         length status filter will match any packet's status.

         The value of the packet status is a sum.  This sum
         initially takes the value zero.  Then, for each
         error, E, that has been discovered in this packet,
         2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum.
         The errors and the bits that represent them are dependent
         on the media type of the interface that this channel
         is receiving packets from.

         The errors defined for a packet captured off of an
         Ethernet interface are as follows:

             bit #    Error
                 0    Packet is longer than 1518 octets
                 1    Packet is shorter than 64 octets
                 2    Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error

         For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a
         value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2).

         As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object
         will have other media-specific errors defined.

         For the purposes of this status matching algorithm, if the
         packet status is longer than this filterPktStatus object,
         this object is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it
         reaches the size of the packet status.

 -- The Event Group

 -- Implementation of the Event group is optional.
 -- Consult the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro for the authoritative

 --
 -- The Event group controls the generation and notification
 -- of events from this device.  Each entry in the eventTable
 -- describes the parameters of the event that can be triggered.
 -- Each event entry is fired by an associated condition located
 -- elsewhere in the MIB.  An event entry may also be associated
 -- with a function elsewhere in the MIB that will be executed
 -- when the event is generated.  For example, a channel may
 -- be turned on or off by the firing of an event.
 --
 -- Each eventEntry may optionally specify that a log entry
 -- be created on its behalf whenever the event occurs.
 -- Each entry may also specify that notification should
 -- occur by way of SNMP trap messages.  In this case, the
 -- community for the trap message is given in the associated
 -- eventCommunity object.  The enterprise and specific trap
 -- fields of the trap are determined by the condition that
 -- triggered the event.  Two traps are defined: risingAlarm and
 -- fallingAlarm.  If the eventTable is triggered by a condition
 -- specified elsewhere, the enterprise and specific trap fields

    DESCRIPTION
        "To be used for the index to a table.  Allows an application
        to download only those rows changed since a particular time.
        A row is considered changed if the value of any object in the
        row changes or if the row is created or deleted.

        When sysUpTime is equal to zero, this table shall be empty.

        One entry exists for each past value of sysUpTime, except that
        the whole table is purged should sysUpTime wrap.

        As this basic row is updated new conceptual rows are created
        (which still share the now updated object values with all
        other instances).  The number of instances which are created
        is determined by the value of sysUpTime at which the basic row
        was last updated.  One instance will exist for each value of
        sysUpTime at the last update time for the row.  A new
        timeMark instance is created for each new sysUpTime value.
        Each new conceptual row will be associated with the timeMark
        instance which was created at the value of sysUpTime with
        which the conceptual row is to be associated.

        By definition all conceptual rows were updated at or after
        time zero and so at least one conceptual row (associated with
        timeMark.0) must exist for each underlying (basic) row.

        See the appendix for further discussion of this variable.

        Consider the following fooTable:

        fooTable ...
        INDEX { fooTimeMark, fooIndex }

        FooEntry {
           fooTimeMark  TimeFilter

           fooCounts    Counter
        }

        Should there be two basic rows in this table (fooIndex == 1,
        fooIndex == 2) and row 1 was updated most recently at time 6,
        while row 2 was updated most recently at time 8, and both rows
        had been updated on several earlier occasions such that the
        current values were 5 and 9 respectively then the following
        fooCounts instances would exist.

        Despite the algorithmic mechanism, the probe will only place

    DESCRIPTION
        "This object describes 2 attributes of this protocol
         directory entry.

         The presence or absence of the `extensible' bit describes
         whether or not this protocol directory entry can be extended


         by the user by creating protocol directory entries which are
         children of this protocol.

         An example of an entry that will often allow extensibility is
         `ip.udp'.  The probe may automatically populate some children
         of this node such as `ip.udp.snmp' and `ip.udp.dns'.
         A probe administrator or user may also populate additional
         children via remote SNMP requests that create entries in this
         table.  When a child node is added for a protocol for which the
         probe has no built in support, extending a parent node (for
         which the probe does have built in support),
         that child node is not extendible.  This is termed `limited
         extensibility'.

         When a child node is added through this extensibility
         mechanism, the values of protocolDirLocalIndex and
         protocolDirType shall be assigned by the agent.

         The other objects in the entry will be assigned by the
         manager who is creating the new entry.

         This object also describes whether or not this agent can
         recognize addresses for this protocol, should it be a network
         level protocol.  That is, while a probe may be able to
         recognize packets of a particular network layer protocol and
         count them, it takes additional logic to be able to recognize
         the addresses in this protocol and to populate network layer
         or application layer tables with the addresses in this
         protocol.  If this bit is set, the agent will recognize
         network layer addresses for this protoocl and populate the
         network and application layer host and matrix tables with
         these protocols.

         Note that when an entry is created, the agent will supply
         values for the bits that match the capabilities of the agent

-- User History Collection Group (usrHistory)
--
-- The usrHistory group combines mechanisms seen in the alarm and
-- history groups to provide user-specified history collection,
-- utilizing two additional control tables and one additional data
-- table. This function has traditionally been done by NMS
-- applications, via periodic polling.  The usrHistory group allows
-- this task to be offloaded to an RMON probe.
--
-- Data (an ASN.1 INTEGER based object) is collected in the same
-- manner as any history data table (e.g. etherHistoryTable) except
-- that the user specifies the MIB instances to be collected. Objects
-- are collected in bucket-groups, with the intent that all MIB
-- instances in the same bucket-group are collected as atomically as
-- possible by the RMON probe.
--
-- The usrHistoryControlTable is a one-dimensional read-create table.
-- Each row configures a collection of user history buckets, much
-- the same as a historyControlEntry, except that the creation of a
-- row in this table will cause one or more associated instances in
-- the usrHistoryObjectTable to be created. The user specifies the
-- number of bucket elements (rows in the usrHistoryObjectTable)
-- requested, as well as the number of buckets requested.
--
-- The usrHistoryObjectTable is a 2-d read-write table.
-- Each row configures a single MIB instance to be collected.
-- All rows with the same major index constitute a bucket-group.
--
-- The usrHistoryTable is a 3-d read-only table containing
-- the data of associated usrHistoryControlEntries. Each
-- entry represents the value of a single MIB instance
-- during a specific sampling interval (or the rate of
-- change during the interval).
--
-- A sample value is stored in two objects - an absolute value and
-- a status object. This allows numbers from -(2G-1) to +4G to be
-- stored.  The status object also indicates whether a sample is
-- valid. This allows data collection to continue if periodic
-- retrieval of a particular instance fails for any reason.
--
-- Row Creation Order Relationships
--


-- The static nature of the usrHistoryObjectTable creates
-- some row creation/modification issues. The rows in this
-- table need to be set before the associated
-- usrHistoryControlEntry can be activated.
--
-- Note that the usrHistoryObject entries associated with a
-- particular usrHistoryControlEntry are not required to
-- be active before the control entry is activated. However,
-- the usrHistory data entries associated with an inactive
-- usrHistoryObject entry will be inactive (i.e.
-- usrHistoryValStatus == valueNotAvailable).

ControlString ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This data type is used to communicate with a modem or a
        serial data switch.  A ControlString contains embedded
        commands to control how the device will interact with the
        remote device through the serial interface.  Commands are
        represented as two character sequences beginning with
        the `^' character.

        The following commands are recognized by the device (note
        that command characters are case sensitive):

           ^s  Send string that follows which is terminated by the
               next command or the end of string.
           ^c  Delay for the number of seconds that follows.  Toss
               out any data received rather than storing it in a
               buffer for parsing.
           ^t  Set timeout to the value represented by the decimal
               digits that follow.  The default timeout is 20
               seconds. Note that this timeout may be overridden
               by a smaller serialTimeout configured for the


               associated serial interface (see serialConfigTable).
           ^w  Wait for the reply string that follows which is
               terminated by the next command or the end of string.
               Partial and case insensitive matching is applied, ie.
               if the reply string (any case combination) is found
               anywhere in the received string, then the a match is
               found.  If the current timeout elapses without a match,
               then the remaining control string is ignored.
           ^!  The ^ character.
           ^d  Delay the number of seconds specified by the decimal
               digits that follow.
           ^b  Send break for the number of milliseconds specified by
               the decimal digits that follow.  If no digits follow,
               break will be enforced for 250 milliseconds by default.

        The following ASCII control characters may be inserted into
        the `^s' send string or the `^w' reply string:

           ^@    0x00
           ^A    0x01
            ..
           ^M    0x0D
            ..
           ^Z    0x1A
           ^[    0x1B
           ^    0x1C
           ^]    0x1D
           ^^    0x1E
           ^_    0x1F

        Binary data may also be inserted into the data stream.  The
        control sequence for each byte of binary data is ^0x##, where
        ## is the hexadecimal representation of the data byte.  Two
        ASCII characters (0-9, a-f, A-F) must follow the `^0x'
        control prefix.  For example, `^0x0D^0x0A' is interpreted as a
        carriage return followed by a line feed."

    DESCRIPTION
        "Each octet within this value specifies a set of eight
        ports, with the first octet specifying ports 1 through
        8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc.
        Within each octet, the most significant bit represents
        the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit
        represents the highest numbered port.  Thus, each port
        of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the
        value of this object.  If that bit has a value of '1'
        then that port is included in the set of ports; the port
        is not included if its bit has a value of '0'."

        global scope within a given bridged domain (see VlanId
        textual convention).  If the value is greater than 4095
        then it represents a VLAN with scope local to the
        particular agent, i.e. one without a global VLAN-ID
        assigned to it. Such VLANs are outside the scope of
        IEEE 802.1Q but it is convenient to be able to manage them

          An InetAddress value is always interpreted within the
          context of an InetAddressType value. The InetAddressType
          object which defines the context must be registered
          immediately before the object which uses the InetAddress
          textual convention. In other words, the object identifiers

          MUST have the same length and the last sub-identifier of
          the InetAddressType object MUST be 1 less than the last
          sub-identifier of the InetAddress object.

          When this textual convention is used as the syntax of an
          index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128
          sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2, STD 58. In this case,
          the OBJECT-TYPE declaration MUST include a 'SIZE' clause

          (e.g. link-local or site-local addresses), the scope
          identifier MUST always be present. It contains a link
          identifier for link-local and a site identifier for
          site-local IPv6 addresses.

          The scope identifier MUST disambiguate identical address
          values. For link-local addresses, the scope identifier will
          typically be the interface index (ifIndex as defined in the
          IF-MIB, RFC 2233) of the interface on which the address is
          configured.

          The scope identifier may contain the special value 0
          which refers to the default scope. The default scope
          may be used in cases where the valid scope identifier
          is not known (e.g., a management application needs to
          write a site-local InetAddressIPv6 address without
          knowing the site identifier value). The default scope
          SHOULD NOT be used as an easy way out in cases where

DESCRIPTION
     "This MIB module defines a collection of objects for managing
      HDSL2/SHDSL lines.  An agent may reside at either end of the
      line, however the MIB is designed to require no management
      communication between the modems beyond that inherent in the
      low-level EOC line protocol as defined in ANSI T1E1.4/2000-006
      (for HDSL2 lines), or in ITU G.991.2 (for SHDSL lines)."

   DESCRIPTION
     "A gauge associated with interface performance measurements in
      a current 1-day (24 hour) measurement interval.

      The value of this gauge starts at zero at the beginning of an
      interval and is increased when associated events occur, until
      the end of the 1-day interval.  At that time the value of the
      gauge is stored in the previous 1-day history interval, as
      defined in a companion object of type


      Hdsl2Shdsl1DayIntevalCount, and the current interval gauge
      is restarted at zero.

      In the case where the agent has no valid data available for
      this interval the corresponding object instance is not
      available and upon a retrieval request a corresponding error
      message shall be returned to indicate that this instance does

     loswFailureAlarm       Indicates a forward LOSW alarm.

     configInitFailure      Endpoint failure during initialization
                            due to paired endpoint not able to
                            support requested configuration.

     protocolInitFailure    Endpoint failure during initialization
                            due to incompatible protocol used by
                            the paired endpoint.

     noNeighborPresent      Endpoint failure during initialization
                            due to no activation sequence detected
                            from paired endpoint.

     loopbackActive         A loopback is currently active at this
                            Segment Endpoint.

     This is intended to supplement ifOperStatus.  Note that there
     is a 1-1 relationship between the status bits defined in this
     object and the notification thresholds defined elsewhere in

                 dsx1JBZS refers the Jammed Bit Zero Suppression,
                 in which the AT&T specification of at least one
                 pulse every 8 bit periods is literally implemented
                 by forcing a pulse in bit 8 of each channel.
                 Thus, only seven bits per channel, or 1.344 Mbps,
                 is available for data.

                 dsx1B8ZS refers to the use of a specified pattern
                 of normal bits and bipolar violations which are
                 used to replace a sequence of eight zero bits.

                 ANSI Clear Channels may use dsx1ZBTSI, or Zero
                 Byte Time Slot Interchange.

                 E1 links, with or without CRC, use dsx1HDB3 or
                 dsx1AMI.

                 dsx1AMI refers to a mode wherein no zero code
                 suppression is present and the line encoding does
                 not solve the problem directly.  In this
                 application, the higher layer must provide data
                 which meets or exceeds the pulse density
                 requirements, such as inverting HDLC data.

                 dsx1B6ZS refers to the user of a specifed pattern

                 "This table is deprecated in favour of using
                 ifStackTable.

                 The table was mandatory for systems dividing a DS1
                 into channels containing different data streams
                 that are of local interest.  Systems which are
                 indifferent to data content, such as CSUs, need
                 not implement it.

                 The DS1 fractional table identifies which DS1
                 channels associated with a CSU are being used to
                 support a logical interface, i.e., an entry in the
                 interfaces table from the Internet-standard MIB.

                 For example, consider an application managing a
                 North American ISDN Primary Rate link whose
                 division is a 384 kbit/s H1 _B_ Channel for Video,


                 a second H1 for data to a primary routing peer,
                 and 12 64 kbit/s H0 _B_ Channels. Consider that
                 some subset of the H0 channels are used for voice
                 and the remainder are available for dynamic data
                 calls.

                 We count a total of 14 interfaces multiplexed onto
                 the DS1 interface. Six DS1 channels (for the sake
                 of the example, channels 1..6) are used for Video,
                 six more (7..11 and 13) are used for data, and the
                 remaining 12 are are in channels 12 and 14..24.

                 Let us further imagine that ifIndex 2 is of type
                 DS1 and refers to the DS1 interface, and that the
                 interfaces layered onto it are numbered 3..16.

                 We might describe the allocation of channels, in
                 the dsx1FracTable, as follows:
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 1 = 3  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.13 = 4
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 2 = 3  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.14 = 6
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 3 = 3  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.15 = 7
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 4 = 3  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.16 = 8
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 5 = 3  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.17 = 9
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 6 = 3  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.18 = 10
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 7 = 4  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.19 = 11
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 8 = 4  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.20 = 12
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 9 = 4  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.21 = 13
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2.10 = 4  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.22 = 14
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2.11 = 4  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.23 = 15

                 For North American (DS1) interfaces, there are 24
                 legal channels, numbered 1 through 24.

DomainName ::=  TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       STATUS  current
       DESCRIPTION
            "The domain name space is a tree structure.  Each node and 
            leaf on the tree corresponds to a resource set (which may be 
            empty).  The domain system makes no distinctions between the 
            uses of the interior nodes and leaves, and this memo uses the 
            term 'node' to refer to both. Each node has a label, which is 
            zero to 63 octets in length.  Brother nodes may not have the 
            same label, although the same label can be used for nodes 
            which are not brothers.  One label is reserved, and that is
            the null (i.e., zero length) label used for the root.
            The domain name of a node is the list of the labels on the 
            path from the node to the root of the tree.  By convention, 
            the labels that compose a domain name are printed or read 
            left to right, from the most specific (lowest, farthest from 
            the root) to the least specific (highest, closest to the 
            root).
 
            Internally, programs that manipulate domain names should 
            represent them as sequences of labels, where each label is a 
            length octet followed by  an octet string.  Because all domain 
            names end at the root, which has a null string for a label, 
            these internal representations can use a length byte of zero 
            to terminate a domain name.
 
            By convention, domain names can be stored with arbitrary case, but
            domain name comparisons for all present domain functions are done in 
            a case-insensitive manner, assuming an ASCII character set, and a 
            high order zero bit.  This means that you are free to create a node 
            with label 'A' or a node with label 'a', but not both as brothers; 
            you could refer to either using 'a' or 'A'.  When you receive a 
            domain name or label, you should preserve its case.  The rationale 
            for this  choice is that we may someday need to add full binary 
            domain names for  new services; existing services would not be 
            changed.
 
            When a user needs to type a domain name, the length of each label is
            omitted and the labels are separated by dots ('.').  Since a complete
            domain name ends with the root label, this leads to a printed form 
            which ends in a dot.  We use this property to distinguish between:
 
            character string which represents a complete domain name
            (often called 'absolute').  For example, 'poneria.ISI.EDU.'
 
           - a character string that represents the starting labels of a
           domain name which is incomplete, and should be completed by
           local software using knowledge of the local domain (often
           called 'relative').  For example, 'poneria' used in the
           ISI.EDU domain.
 
           Relative names are either taken relative to a well known 
           origin, or to a list of domains used as a search list.  Relative 
           names appear mostly at the user interface, where their interpretation 
           varies  from implementation to implementation, and in master files, 
           where they  are  relative to a single origin domain name.  The most 
           common interpretation uses the root '.' as either the single origin 
           or as one of the members of the search list, so a multi-label relative 
           name is often one where the trailing dot has been omitted to save 
           typing.
 
           To simplify implementations, the total number of octets that represent  a
           domain name (i.e., the sum of all label octets and label lengths) is
           limited to 255.
 
           A domain is identified by a domain name, and consists of that part of
           the domain name space that is at or below the domain name which
           specifies the domain.  A domain is a subdomain of another domain if it
           is contained within that domain.  This relationship can be tested by
           seeing if the subdomain's name ends with the containing domain's name.
           For example, A.B.C.D is a subdomain of B.C.D, C.D, D, and  '.' "

   SnmpAdminString ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
        DISPLAY-HINT "255a"
        STATUS       current
        DESCRIPTION "An octet string containing administrative
           information, preferably in human-readable form.
 
           To facilitate internationalization, this
           information is represented using the ISO/IEC
           IS 10646-1 character set, encoded as an octet
           string using the UTF-8 transformation format
           described in [RFC2044].
 
           Since additional code points are added by
           amendments to the 10646 standard from time
           to time, implementations must be prepared to
           encounter any code point from 0x00000000 to
           0x7fffffff.
 
           The use of control codes should be avoided.
 
           When it is necessary to represent a newline,
           the control code sequence CR LF should be used.
 
 
           The use of leading or trailing white space should
           be avoided.
 
           For code points not directly supported by user
           interface hardware or software, an alternative
           means of entry and display, such as hexadecimal,
           may be provided.
 
           For information encoded in 7-bit US-ASCII,
           the UTF-8 encoding is identical to the
           US-ASCII encoding.
 
           Note that when this TC is used for an object that
           is used or envisioned to be used as an index, then
           a SIZE restriction must be specified so that the
           number of sub-identifiers for any object instance
           does not exceed the limit of 128, as defined by

       " Use of the File Tranfer MIB could be used with other MIBS in
              the following manner:
                  a) Use another MIB/means to verify available space /make room
                     for a file to be transfered to this device
                  b) Use this MIB to download the file
                  c) Use another MIB/means to select the file you want to make 
                     active
                                        if your selecting firmware for example.
                  d) Use another MIB/means to reset the device.

        A management station wishing to initiate a file transfer needs to
                         create an entry in this table. To do so, you must
       first identify the entPhysicalIndex of the device you intend to
       do the transfer with.  You should
       then create the associated instance of the row status
       It must also, either in the same
       or in successive PDUs, create an instance of
       mpeDevFileXferFileName, mpeDevFileXferFileType, 
.      mpeDevFileXferServerIpAddress,
       mpeDevFileXferOperation.

       It should also modify the default values for the other
       configuration objects if the defaults are not appropriate.

       Once the appropriate instance of all the configuration
       objects have been created, either by an explicit SNMP
       set request or by default, the row status should be set
       to active to initiate the request. Note that this entire
       procedure may be initiated via a single set request which
       specifies a row status of createAndGo as well as specifies
       valid values for the non-defaulted configuration objects.

       Once the MpeDevFileXferConfigEntry request has been created (i.e. the
       mpeDevFileXferRowStatus has been made active), the entry
       cannot be modified - the only operation possible
       after this is to delete the row.

       Once the request completes, the management station should
       retrieve the values of the status objects of interest, and
       should then delete the entry.  In order to prevent old
       entries from clogging the table, entries could be aged out,
       but an entry will never be deleted within 5 minutes of
       completing.  "

  DESCRIPTION
   "The mpe dslam MIB. This MIB is written specifically to
   extend entPhysicalTable." 

   REVISION "200306060000Z"  -- June 6, 2003
   DESCRIPTION "Jesus Pinto and Clay Sikes
               Removed the entPhysicalIndex as an object in the
               mpeAlarmRelayInputStateChanged notification. This
               object was redundant in that it's the instance
               part of the mpeAlarmRelayState object."

   REVISION "200304250000Z"  -- April 25, 2003
   DESCRIPTION "Jesus Pinto and Clay Sikes
               Change mpeAlarmRelayInputState to mpeAlarmRelayState
               and changed it from a read-only object to a read-
               write object. This should give ultimate flexibility."

   REVISION "200304180000Z"  -- April 18, 2003
   DESCRIPTION "Jesus Pinto and Clay Sikes
               Needed objects to read Alarm Relay Input State. The
               addition of mpeEntPhysicalExtAlarmRelayInputContactState
               below was not a good idea as it implied a dense augments.
               mpeEntPhysicalExtAlarmRelayInputContactState was deprecated.

               Added a new table, mpeAlarmRelayTable to hold alarm
               relay objects where the table implies a sparse augments.
               Deprecated mpeAlarmRrelayEquipmentIndex, 
               mpeAlarmRelayInputContactState, and the
               mpeAlarmRelayInputcontactStateChanged trap they were
               designed for to discourage use in new projects. Added a new 
               trap, mpeAlarmRelayInputStateChanged, as a replacement that
               uses objects defined in or related to the mpeAlarmRelayTable.

               The mpeAlarmRelayTable allows Alarm Relay Input state to be
               read and has a direct relationship with the objects defined
               for the mpeAlarmRelayInputStateChanged trap. Since this table
               is indexed the entPhysicalIndex, it is extremely flexible in 
               that it can apply to a Single Management Entity / Single 
               Logical Entity, a chassis, or what ever level of granularity 
               is desired in the implementation."

   REVISION "200303201500Z"  -- March 20, 2003

		entConfigChange notification defined in RFC2737."

                       changed to Integer32.  
                   2.  Reworked the conformance.  Had to change the OID 
                       structure because the MODULE-COMPLIANCE section
                       was missing resulting in `group-unref' issues.
                   3.  The OID for unauthorizedUserEvent was change
                       such that the second-to-the-last number is now
                       `0' to satisfy SMIv2.
                   4.  Masked the warning that 
                       pdnNetTo8023MediaConfigVnidId should be 
                       non-accessible.
                   5.  Changed the import for ifIndex to be the IF-MIB.
                   6.  Change the import for ipNetToMedia objects to be
                       the IP-MIB.

                Added the pdnNetToMediaParamsAprTable to support 
                periodic sending of ARP requests.

                Noticed several inconsistencies with respect to ranges
                specified in the syntax clause and where was described
                in the description text.  These inconsistencies were
                not touched as in doing so could cause over-the-wire
                issues.

-- Configuration Change Keys Table
--
-- This table contains a set of keys specific to each non-volatile
-- database on the device.  The keys are ensured to change each time
-- there is a change to the database that they represent.
--
-- Example of Use:
--
--   1) Database Discovery
--      This MIB can be used to discover the various non-volatile
--      databases on a device.  Each database has a unique key.
--
--      The discovery process consists of walking devConfigChangeKeysDbKey.
--      Each response corresponds to a different database type.  The NMS
--      only needs to be concerned with the databases that affect them.
--      Each of the "interesting" database keys should be stored for later
--      reference.
--
--   2) Database monitoring
--         After discovery, the NMS can check the database keys of the
--         databases of interest to it either at specific intervals or
--         based on configuration change traps.  When using trap directed,
--         polling, a default polling interval should still apply in case
--         a trap is lost in the transmission process.
--         
--         Checking the keys consists of performing a get operation on
--         devConfigChangeKeysDbKey for the specific database(s) of interest.  
--         If the key has changed from that previously stored, the database
--         has changed.  The new key should be stored for future reference.

       " Use of the File Transfer MIB could be used with other MIBS in
              the following manner:
                  a) Use another MIB/means to verify available space /make room
                     for a file to be transferred to this device
                  b) Use this MIB to download the file
                  c) Use another MIB/means to select the file you want to make 
                     active
                                        if your selecting firmware for example.
                  d) Use another MIB/means to reset the device.

        A management station wishing to initiate a file transfer needs to
                         create an entry in this table. To do so, you must
       first identify the ifIndex of the device you intend to
       do the transfer with.  You should
       then create the associated instance of the row status
       It must also, either in the same
       or in successive PDUs, create an instance of
       devFileXferFileName, DevFileXferFileType, 
.      devFileXferServerIpAddress,
       devFileXferOperation.

       It should also modify the default values for the other
       configuration objects if the defaults are not appropriate.

       Once the appropriate instance of all the configuration
       objects have been created, either by an explicit SNMP
       set request or by default, the row status should be set
       to active to initiate the request. Note that this entire
       procedure may be initiated via a single set request which
       specifies a row status of createAndGo as well as specifies
       valid values for the non-defaulted configuration objects.

       Once the DevFileXferConfigEntry request has been created (i.e. the
       devFileXferRowStatus has been made active), the entry
       cannot be modified - the only operation possible
       after this is to delete the row.

       Once the request completes, the management station should
       retrieve the values of the status objects of interest, and
       should then delete the entry.  In order to prevent old
       entries from clogging the table, entries could be aged out,
       but an entry will never be deleted within 5 minutes of
       completing.  "

       It should also modify the default values for the other
       configuration objects if the defaults are not appropriate.

       Once the appropriate instance of all the configuration
       objects have been created, either by an explicit SNMP
       set request or by default, the row status should be set
       to active to initiate the request. Note that this entire
       procedure may be initiated via a single set request which
       specifies a row status of createAndGo as well as specifies
       valid values for the non-defaulted configuration objects.

       Once the request completes, the management station should
       retrieve the values of the status objects of interest, and
       should then delete the entry.  In order to prevent old
       entries from clogging the table, entries could be aged out,
       but an entry will never be deleted within 5 minutes of
       completing.  "

                 and devSecurityMgrFailedValidationCount such that the

--
--    The  HotWire Diagnostics MIB
--
--    This MIB provides an NMS to trigger a diagnostic test 
--    The tests that can be performed are grouped into the following
--    categories :
--       1. Device Tests ( Self, Test Reset ...) 
--       2. interface related tests (bert test, packet loopback ...)
--       3. application based diagnostic tests (Ping, TraceRoute ...)
--
--    Interface related tests (2) are an exception. An NMS will use
--    the ifTestTable of RFC1573 to start these tests. However if any 
--    of the interface related tests need to have inputs. those tests
--    will use the objects defined under the ifTestInput group.
--    Hence in these cases implementation of the following groups
--    are mandatory.
--       ifDeviceInput
--       ifDeviceResults - This group is mandatory if more specific 
--                         information about the results is required
--                         (other than ifTestResult - RFC 1573,ifTestTable) 
--                         to be sent back to an NMS.
--                         Hence in these cases it is left to the 
--                         implementor of the device to put
--                         the OID of the object or results table
--                         containing such specifics to be put
--                         in ifTestCode (RFC 1573, ifTestTable).
--       Note  that the above mentioned groups compliment the ifTestTable
--       of RFC 1573
--
--    if the device supports device tests (1), the devControl.mib needs
--    to be implemented. In addition the following group needs to be 
--    implemented 
--       deviceTestInput
--       deviceTestResults
--
--    if the device supports application tests (1). implementation of the
--    following groups are mandatory.
--       applTests

-- History
--
-- 05/02/2000
--
-- Removed integer ranges as those should be designated in the
-- product documentation
--
-- 06/07/2000
--
-- Corrected spelling errors in Probe1,2,3, etc.
--
-- 10/04/2001
--
-- Added a new Interface test called BLERT (Block Error Rate Test)
-- which is intended for MVL.

                        face and only one jack is valid at a time. Consider two
                        cases:

                        1. A product supports two types of jacks, a RJ45 copper-
                           wire interface and a SFP fiber interface. The product is 
                           required to have the user set the active jack or allow it 
                           to be auto detected. The values for this object that 
                           allow the requirement to be satisfied and their interp-
                           retation are as follows:
                           a. fiber(1) - The fiber jack is active and the others, 
                                         e.g. rj45, are ignored.
                           b. rj45(2)  - The rj45 jack is actie and the others, 
                                         eg.fiber, are ignored.
                           c. auto(3)  - Either jack can be used and it is up
                                         to the implementation to determine which
                                         jack has presedence when both jacks are
                                         active. This determination must be clearly
                                         documented in the SNMP Operational Speci-
                                         fication.
                            No default is specified for this MIB object so the default

                            wire interface and s SFP fiber interface. The product is
                            required to have the user select which jack has priority
                            when both jacks are active. The values for this object
                            that allow the requirement to be satisfied and their 
                            interpretation are as follos:
                            a. fiber(1) - The fiber jack has priority.
                            b. rj45(2)  - The rj45 jack has priority.

-- The sysDevFilterConfigTable is used to create new filters.
-- To create new filter, filter index, filter name, type and 
-- and default action are neccessary to be specified. Next the 
-- user should create rules that will be attached to his filter. 
-- To create rule user should use L2 or L3, L4 FilterRuleTable)
-- depending on what type of rules user needs to create. To create
-- L2 (layer two) rule user needs to specify rule index, rule name, 
-- ether type (RFC 1700) and frame type that will be accepted. 
-- The user should also configure what action should be taken if  
-- the rule is matched to a frame. The ether type can be a range
-- of hex numbers (2bytes) so range objects should be used. 
-- Next the rule should be bound to one or more filters that are 
-- created. This binding is done by using FilterToRule binding 
-- table. This table is indexed by rule index and
-- filter index. Next the filter-rule binding (completed filter) 
-- should be bound to an interface by using FilterBindingTable. 
-- This table is indexed by ifIndex (interface we want filter 
-- bound to), filter index and direction that filter/rule 
-- combination is applied to (inboudn, outbound and inboundoutbound).
-- After this step the filter will take in effect and every 
-- packet on this interface will be examined for rule or set of  
-- rules that are bound to this filter. Filter should not be 
-- bound to an interface if the rule is not bound to a filter.
-- it can be done but the default action will take in effect 
-- and every packet will be checked. The rule cannot be deleted  
-- until all filter-rule bindings for this filter are deleted.
-- The rule cannot be deleted until all filter-interface 
-- bindings for this filter are disabled.

    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB contains objects that are used to configure Uplink Tagging (ULT). 
        Uplink Tagging is a term used to describe a feature that simplifies the
        setup and administration of networks where a service provider wants to
        use a unique VLAN per subscriber port. Ingress frames will get tagged
        with a VLAN and these tagged frame will be transmitted on the uplink port
        towards the WAN.

        In cases where the hardware implementation permits, multiple units can be
        interconnected together to form a 'Uplink Tagging Domain (ULT Domain)'. A ULT
        domain is defined as the set of interconnected Paradyne DSLAMs that share a 
        common block of VLAN IDs. The maximum number of Paradyne DSLAMs that can be 
        interconnected is implementation dependent. Generally, all DSLAMs in a ULT
        Domain will be configured with the same block of VLAN IDs. Each chassis/unit
        will be assigned a unique ULT Index within the ULT Domain.

        There are two parts of configuring Uplink Tagging:
        1. Uplink Base VLAN Tag - This object specifies the beginning VLAN ID for a
                                  particular common block of VLAN IDs. This object 
                                  will be defined as an enumeration whose values will
                                  depend on the number of port in a chassis/unit.
        2. Uplink Tag Index     - This object specifies the index within some block
                                  of VLAN IDs. Generally, this index can thought of a
                                  chassis/unit number as can be seen with the examples
                                  below."

        
    REVISION "200303120000Z"  -- March 12, 2003
    DESCRIPTION "Deprecated the origional objects, ultBaseVlanTag and
                ultIndex. Added new objects as follows:
                1. pdnUltIndex         - This new object is basically an Unsigned32
                                         that excludes '0'. It idea is that different
                                         implementations will support different maximum
                                         values of the index. As such, the syntax for
                                         this object will cover any implementation and
                                         actual implementation specific maximum values 
                                         should be documented in something like the 
                                         implementation's SNMP Op Spec.
               2. pdnGenUltBaseVlanTag - This object allows a any base VLAN Tag to
                                         be defined.
               3. pdn48UltBaseVlanTag  - This object defines a set of enumerations
                                         for base VLAN Tags for chassis/units that
                                         contain 48 ports. 
               4. pdn24UltBaseVlanTag  - This object defines a set of enumerations
                                         for base VLAN Tags for chassis/units that
                                         contain 24 ports."

        describing the Loop Length of a circuit. Following are the
        details of each of the options:

            none(1)       - Indicates that the Spectral Compliance
                            is NOT dependant on any Loop Length
                            measurements or configurations.
            loopLength(2) - The 'ConfLoopLength' object is used to
                            determine spectral compliance. The
                            'ConfEWL' & 'ConfQuadMode' objects are
                            not used in this mode.
            ewl(3)        - The 'ConfEWL' object is used to
                            configure the estimated loop length,
                            which is used to determine spectral
                            compliance. In this mode the
                            'ConfLoopLength' & 'ConfQuadMode'
                            objects are not used. 
            quadMode(4)   - The 'ConfQuadMode' object is used to
                            determine spectral compliance. The
                            'ConfEWL' & 'ConfLoopLength' objects
                            are not used in this mode.

        This object determines which of the three objects :
        'ConfEWL', 'ConfLoopLength' or 'ConfQuadMode' is used
        (if any) to enforce spectrally compliant maximum
        'Tx Rates' and the maximum allowed 'Tx Power' on a given

    DESCRIPTION
        "The primary purpose of this MIB is to allow support of G.shdsl.bis based 
         on the ITU Temporary Document, DC-R15, April 2003, until such a time
         as the `standard' MIB, HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB, RFC 3276, May 2002 is
         updated to support G.shdsl.bis. In addition to providing support for
         G.shdsl.bis, this MIB may support SHDSL objects that are unique to the
         enterprise.

         Decisions as far as how this MIB is supported with respect to the 
         `standard' MIB will be made in an individual basis by those involved 
         with specific projects; those decisions are not dictated here.

         The following documents should be referenced with respect to this MIB:
         [G.991.2]     ITU-T G991.2 `Single-pair high-speed digital subscriber 
                       line (SHDSL) transceivers,' December 2003.
         [DC-R15]      ITU Study Group 15 Temporary Document `G.shdsl.bis: Draft
                       Text`, April 2003.

                 to support higher rates such as the 5696 kbits per second

    REVISION "200404210000Z"  -- April 21, 2004
    DESCRIPTION "Changed the pdnHdsl2ShdslSpanStatusExtTable and the
                 pdnHdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfileExtTable from augments to be
                 indexed. Some SNMP agents do a read-modify-write on a table
                 row. As a result, the instrumentation code may not be able to 
                 determine which object the manager actually wants to set. For 
                 example, consider the case where a manager wants to set the 
                 wire interface to 8-wire operation. The instrumentation code, in
                 the case of a read-modify-write cycle, could result in receiving
                 a row where the hdsl2ShdslSpanConfWireInterface is set to 
                 twoWire(1) and pdnHdsl2ShdslSpanConfWireInterface is set to
                 eightWire(4). This could result in unpredictable results. 
                 This change will prevent the objects in the ExtTables from
                 existing in the same row as the objects in the standard tables
                 and prevent the unpredictable case from occurring."

         not have any work on the 'standard' MIBs planned and/or has not produced 
         a schedule to address ADSL2/ADSL2plus needs. As a result, these objects may 
         be a `temporary' solution until MIBs/Objects are defined or extended to 
         meet the needs of ADSL2/ADSL2plus.

         The following documents that should be referenced with respect
         to this MIB:

    REVISION "200503290000Z"  -- March 29, 2005
    DESCRIPTION "The `special' value was missing in the syntax for
                 pdnAdslLineStatusAtucActAtp and pdnAdslLineStatusAtucActAtp.

                 Added a note in the pdnAdslLineSubCarStatusTable indicating 
                 that some objects may not be valid if a loop diagnostic has
                 not completed execution.

                 pdnAdslLineSubCarAtucHlogMt and pdnAdslLineSubCarAturHlogMt
                 were incorrectly represented.  These object had the syntax
                 and description of HLOGpsds and HLOGpsus from G.997.1.
                 Corrected the syntax and description for the HlogMt objects
                 and added pdnAdslLineSubCarAtucHlogPs and 
                 pdnAdslLineSubCarAturHlogPs objects."

    REVISION "200501060000Z"  -- January 6, 2005
    DESCRIPTION "Changed the identifiers for the objects in the 
                 pdnAdslLineStatusTable and the pdnAdslLineSubCarStatusTable
                 from `Ds' to `Atuc' and from `Us' to `Atur'.  When these
                 tables were first created, it was not absolutely clear how 
                 `Ds' and `Us' mapped to `Atuc' and `Atur'.  However in 
                 December 2004, the DSL Forum released TR-090, `Protocol
                 Independent Object Model for Managing Next Generation ADSL
                 Technologies' which notes in Section 5.4.4, `ATU Channel
                 Thresholds' and in Section 5.5.1, `ATU Sub-Carrier Status'
                 that the object instances associated with the ATU-C use
                 the xxxds version of the parameter while those associated
                 with the ATU-R use the xxxus version of the parameter.

                 Paradyne's Compliance Engineering requested a change to
                 the ranges for Maximum Nominal Transmit PSD objects per
                 the Telenor Networks Specification [OA 305], Section 7.2.2,
                 `Downstream transmit spectral mask'.
                 The objects effected were: 
                     pdnAdslPsdConfAtucMaxNomPsd
                        from (-600..-400) to (-800..-400)
                     pdnAdslPsdConfAturMaxNomPsd

    REVISION "200404210000Z"  -- April 21, 2004
    DESCRIPTION "The value for pdnAdslPsdConfAtucMaxNomPsd did not match the range in
                G.997.1 (05/2003), Section 7.3.1.2.1. The correct range is -60 to -40."

    REVISION "200404200000Z"  -- April 20, 2004
    DESCRIPTION "Change the pdnAdslLineExtTable from augments to be indexed. 
                 Some SNMP agents do a read-modify-write on a table row. As 
                 a result, the instrumentation code may not be able to  
                 determine which object the manager actually wants to set. For 
                 example, consider the case where a manager wants to set the 
                 transmission mode to allow ADSL2Plus modes. The instrumentation code, 
                 in the case of a read-modify-write cycle, could result in receiving
                 a row where the adslLineTransAtucConf is is set one way while the
                 pdnAdslLineTransAtucConfig is set another way. This could result 
                 in unpredictable results. This change will prevent the objects in 
                 the ExtTables from existing in the same row as the objects in the 
                 standard tables and prevent the unpredictable case from occurring."

    DESCRIPTION "Correct OID enumerations for objects in the pdnAdslPsdConfTable.
                 The OID 6 was skipped. That is pdnAdslPsdConfAturmaxNomAtp and
                 following objects were renumbered.
                 The pdnAdslLineLdsf object referred to the pdnAdslLinePmsf object
                 which was removed. pdnAdslLineLdsf was updated to remove the
                 reference."

    REVISION "200312080000Z"  -- December 8, 2003
    DESCRIPTION "Updated per MIBwg review. Change special case value for
                 pdnAdslPsdConfAtucMaxRxPwr from 9999 to 2048 to make it easier
                 for an NMS application to detect the special case. Collapse the
                 two Carrier Mask tables, one for upstream and one for downstream,
                 into a single table. The profile name can be used to distinguish

pdnAdslLineExtTable OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX      SEQUENCE OF PdnAdslLineExtEntry
    MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION "This table extends the adslLineTable in support of an 
                 ADSL Line object.

                 The objects pdnAdslLineTransAtucCap, pdnAdslLineTrans-
                 AtucConfig, and pdnAdslLineTransAtucActual exist along
                 with their PdnAdslTransmissionModeType TC because the 
                 AdslTransmissionModeType defined in the ADSL-LINE-EXT-MIB
                 does not include the ADSL2/ADSL2plus bits defined in
                 ITU G.997.1 (05/2003) ATU Transmission System Enabling (ATSE) 
                 section. 

                 When using the objects defined in this MIB with a syntax of 
                 type PdnAdslTransmissionModeType, the interworking relationship
                 between these objects and the objects defined in the ADSL-LINE-
                 EXT-MIB defined with a syntax of type AdslTransmissionModeType
                 must be considered and explained in an implementation-specific
                 document such as an Operational Specification. Note that the
                 PdnAdslTransmissionModeType is a super set of the AdslTransmis-
                 sionModeType. One possible implementation could be as follows:
                     1.  Both objects of syntax AdslTransmissionModeType defined 
                         in the ADSL-LINE-EXT-MIB and objects of syntax PdnAdsl-
                         TransmissionModeType defined in this MIB are supported.
                         By supporting both, a manager with the ADSL-LINE-EXT-MIB
                         loaded could manage the device with the restriction of
                         not being able to utilize ADSL2/ADSL2plus modes.
                     2.  When the ADSL2/ADSL2plus capabilities are desired, a manager
                         would have to use the objects defined in this MIB to 
                         configure the transmission modes, read capability, or
                         read the actual transmission mode of the ATU-C. 
                     3.  The transmission mode that the ATU-C is currently 
                         configured for is based on the last object, adslLineTrans-
                         AtucConfig or pdnAdslLineTransAtucConfig, that was written."

                 loop diagnostics procedures can't be completed successfully, then

    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module defines a portion of the management information base
         (MIB) for managing configuration and monitoring results of SELT
         (Single Ended Line Test) tests over ADSL interfaces.

         At the time this MIB was defined, the IETF ADSL MIB Working does 
         not have any work on the 'standard' MIBs planned and/or has not produced 
         a schedule to address G.SELT needs. As a result, these objects may 
         be a `temporary' solution until MIBs/Objects are defined
         meet the needs of ADSL SELT testing.

   DESCRIPTION "Identifies the unit of transmission.

                The unit other(1) is used when none of the other 
                enumerations apply.  

                The unit bits(2) is used when bits are being 
                transmitted.  

                The unit octets(3) is used for groups of 8 bits.
  
                The unit frames(4) is used for transmission at the data 
                link layer.  A frame may include a header and/or a 
                trailer, along with some number of units of data.

                The unit packets(5) is a basic unit of encapsulation,
                which typically is passed across the interface between
                the network layer and the data link layer.  A packet
                is usually mapped to a frame;  the exceptions are
                when data link layer fragmentation is being performed,
                or when multiple packets are incorporated into a single 
                frame.

                The unit datagrams(6) is a unit of transmission in the
                network layer (such as IP).  A datagram may be 
                encapsulated in one or more packets passed to the data
                link layer."

   DESCRIPTION
      "This MIB module defines a collection of objects for managing
       the bonding of multiple digital subscriber lines (DSL) to 
       transport ATM streams.  

       At the time this modules was defined, neither the IETF nor the
       ATM Forum had any indication of plans to produce MIB modules
       to support the bonding of multiple digital subscriber lines to 
       transport ATM streams.  As a result, these objects may be a 
       `temporary' solution should a standards body produces a module
       to support this type of bonding.

                trying to create rows in the table.

                If the result of the SET for pdnDslAtmBondNextGroupIndex

                changed from index (i.e. another manager used the
                value), so a new value is required.

                The algorithm is:
