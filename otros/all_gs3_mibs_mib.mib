DESCRIPTION
    "The MIB module defining objects for the management of a pair of
    ADSL modems at each end of the ADSL line.  Each such line has

    an entry in an ifTable which may include multiple modem lines.
    An agent may reside at either end of the ADSL line however the
    MIB is designed to require no management communication between
    them beyond that inherent in the low-level ADSL line protocol.
    The agent may monitor and control this protocol for its needs.

    ADSL lines may support optional Fast or Interleaved channels.
    If these are supported, additional entries corresponding to the
    supported channels must be created in the ifTable. Thus an ADSL
    line that supports both channels will have three entries in the
    ifTable, one for each physical, fast, and interleaved, whose
    ifType values are equal to adsl(94), fast(125), and
    interleaved(124), respectively. The ifStackTable is used to
    represent the relationship between the entries.

    Naming Conventions:
              Atuc -- (ATUC) modem at near (Central) end of line
              Atur -- (ATUR) modem at Remote end of line

              Lpr -- Loss of Power
              xxxs-- interval of Seconds in which xxx occurs

                     G.Lite-type mode as denoted by adslLineTransAtucActual.
                     Dual mode exists when the object, adslLineTransAtucConfig,

                     more G.Lite modes simultaneously.

                     When 'dynamic' profiles are implemented, the value of
                     object is equal to the index of the applicable row in the
                     ADSL Line Configuration Profile Table,

                     the profile's name is a string concatenating the
                     ifIndex and one of the follow values: Full or Lite. This
                     string will be fixed-length (i.e., 14) with leading

-- Several objects in this MIB module represent values of
-- timers used by the Spanning Tree Protocol.  In this
-- MIB, these timers have values in units of hundreths of
-- a second (i.e. 1/100 secs).
-- These timers, when stored in a Spanning Tree Protocol's
-- BPDU, are in units of 1/256 seconds.  Note, however,
-- that 802.1D-1990 specifies a settable granularity of
-- no more than 1 second for these timers.  To avoid
-- ambiguity, a data type is defined here as a textual
-- convention and all representation of these timers
-- in this MIB module are defined using this data type.  An
-- algorithm is also defined for converting between the
-- different units, to ensure a timer's value is not
-- distorted by multiple conversions.
-- The data type is:

Timeout ::= INTEGER -- a STP timer in units of 1/100 seconds

-- To convert a Timeout value into a value in units of
-- 1/256 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:
--
--      b  = floor( (n * 256) / 100)
--
-- where:
--      floor   =  quotient [ignore remainder]
--      n is the value in 1/100 second units
--      b is the value in 1/256 second units
--
-- To convert the value from 1/256 second units back to
-- 1/100 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:
--
--      n = ceiling( (b * 100) / 256)
--
-- where:
--      ceiling =  quotient [if remainder is 0], or
--                 quotient + 1 [if remainder is non-zero]
--      n is the value in 1/100 second units
--      b is the value in 1/256 second units
--
-- Note: it is important that the arithmetic operations are
-- done in the order specified (i.e., multiply first, divide
-- second).

                 in which the AT&amp;T specification of at least one
                 pulse every 8 bit periods is literally implemented
                 by forcing a pulse in bit 8 of each channel.
                 Thus, only seven bits per channel, or 1.344 Mbps,
                 is available for data.

                 dsx1B8ZS refers to the use of a specified pattern
                 of normal bits and bipolar violations which are
                 used to replace a sequence of eight zero bits.

                 ANSI Clear Channels may use dsx1ZBTSI, or Zero
                 Byte Time Slot Interchange.

                 E1 links, with or without CRC, use dsx1HDB3 or
                 dsx1AMI.

                 dsx1AMI refers to a mode wherein no zero code
                 suppression is present and the line encoding does
                 not solve the problem directly.  In this
                 application, the higher layer must provide data
                 which meets or exceeds the pulse density
                 requirements, such as inverting HDLC data.

                 dsx1B6ZS refers to the user of a specifed pattern
                 of normal bits and bipolar violations which are
                 used to replace a sequence of six zero bits.  Used
                 for DS2."

          MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
          STATUS  deprecated
          DESCRIPTION
                 "This table is deprecated in favour of using
                 ifStackTable.

                 The table was mandatory for systems dividing a DS1
                 into channels containing different data streams
                 that are of local interest.  Systems which are
                 indifferent to data content, such as CSUs, need
                 not implement it.

                 The DS1 fractional table identifies which DS1
                 channels associated with a CSU are being used to
                 support a logical interface, i.e., an entry in the
                 interfaces table from the Internet-standard MIB.

                 For example, consider an application managing a
                 North American ISDN Primary Rate link whose
                 division is a 384 kbit/s H1 _B_ Channel for Video,


                 a second H1 for data to a primary routing peer,
                 and 12 64 kbit/s H0 _B_ Channels. Consider that
                 some subset of the H0 channels are used for voice
                 and the remainder are available for dynamic data
                 calls.

                 We count a total of 14 interfaces multiplexed onto
                 the DS1 interface. Six DS1 channels (for the sake
                 of the example, channels 1..6) are used for Video,
                 six more (7..11 and 13) are used for data, and the
                 remaining 12 are are in channels 12 and 14..24.

                 Let us further imagine that ifIndex 2 is of type
                 DS1 and refers to the DS1 interface, and that the
                 interfaces layered onto it are numbered 3..16.

                 We might describe the allocation of channels, in
                 the dsx1FracTable, as follows:
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 1 = 3  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.13 = 4
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 2 = 3  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.14 = 6
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 3 = 3  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.15 = 7
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 4 = 3  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.16 = 8
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 5 = 3  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.17 = 9
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 6 = 3  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.18 = 10
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 7 = 4  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.19 = 11
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 8 = 4  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.20 = 12
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 9 = 4  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.21 = 13
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2.10 = 4  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.22 = 14
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2.11 = 4  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.23 = 15
               dsx1FracIfIndex.2.12 = 5  dsx1FracIfIndex.2.24 = 16

                 For North American (DS1) interfaces, there are 24
                 legal channels, numbered 1 through 24.

                 For G.704 interfaces, there are 31 legal channels,
                 numbered 1 through 31.  The channels (1..31)
                 correspond directly to the equivalently numbered
                 time-slots."

          DESCRIPTION
           "An entry in the VPL table.  This entry is
            used to model a bi-directional VPL.
            To create a VPL at an ATM interface,
            either of the following procedures are used:

            Negotiated VPL establishment

          (1) The management application creates
              a VPL entry in the atmVplTable
              by setting atmVplRowStatus to createAndWait(5).
              This may fail for the following reasons:
              - The selected VPI value is unavailable,
              - The selected VPI value is in use.
              Otherwise, the agent creates a row and
              reserves the VPI value on that port.

          (2) The manager selects an existing row(s) in the
              atmTrafficDescrParamTable,
              thereby, selecting a set of self-consistent
              ATM traffic parameters and the service category
              for receive and transmit directions of the VPL.

         (2a) If no suitable row(s) in the
              atmTrafficDescrParamTable exists,
              the manager must create a new row(s)
              in that table.

         (2b) The manager characterizes the VPL's traffic
              parameters through setting the
              atmVplReceiveTrafficDescrIndex and the


              atmVplTransmitTrafficDescrIndex values
              in the VPL table, which point to the rows
              containing desired ATM traffic parameter values
              in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable.  The agent
              will check the availability of resources and
              may refuse the request.
              If the transmit and receive service categories
              are inconsistent, the agent should refuse the
              request.

          (3) The manager activates the VPL by setting the
              the atmVplRowStatus to active(1).
              If this set is successful, the agent has
              reserved the resources to satisfy the requested
              traffic parameter values and the service category
              for that VPL.

          (4) If the VPL terminates a VPC in the ATM host
              or switch, the manager turns on the
              atmVplAdminStatus to up(1) to turn the VPL
              traffic flow on.  Otherwise, the
              atmVpCrossConnectTable  must be used
              to cross-connect the VPL to another VPL(s)
              in an ATM switch or network.

            One-Shot VPL Establishment

            A VPL may also be established in one step by a
            set-request with all necessary VPL parameter
            values and atmVplRowStatus set to createAndGo(4).

            In contrast to the negotiated VPL establishment
            which allows for detailed error checking
            (i.e., set errors are explicitly linked to
            particular resource acquisition failures),
            the one-shot VPL establishment
            performs the setup on one operation but
            does not have the advantage of step-wise
            error checking.

            VPL Retirement

            A VPL is released by setting atmVplRowStatus to
            destroy(6), and the agent may release all
            associated resources."

              in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable.  The agent
              will check the availability of resources and
              may refuse the request.
              If the transmit and receive service categories
              are inconsistent, the agent should refuse the
              request.

          (3) The manager activates the VCL by setting the
              the atmVclRowStatus to active(1) (for
              requirements on this activation see the
              description of atmVclRowStatus).
              If this set is successful, the agent has
              reserved the resources to satisfy the requested
              traffic parameter values and the service category
              for that VCL.
          (4) If the VCL terminates a VCC in the ATM host
              or switch, the manager turns on the
              atmVclAdminStatus to up(1) to turn the VCL
              traffic flow on.  Otherwise, the
              atmVcCrossConnectTable  must be used
              to cross-connect the VCL to another VCL(s)
              in an ATM switch or network.

           One-Shot VCL Establishment

           A VCL may also be established in one step by a
           set-request with all necessary VCL parameter
           values and atmVclRowStatus set to createAndGo(4).

           In contrast to the negotiated VCL establishment
           which allows for detailed error checking
           (i.e., set errors are explicitly linked to
           particular resource acquisition failures),
           the one-shot VCL establishment
           performs the setup on one operation but
           does not have the advantage of step-wise
           error checking.


           VCL Retirement

           A VCL is released by setting atmVclRowStatus to
           destroy(6), and the agent may release all
           associated resources."

               Table, one for each cross-connection between
               two VPLs.  Each row is indexed by the ATM
               interface port numbers and VPI values of the
               two ends of that cross-connection.
               This set of rows specifies the topology of the
               VPC cross-connect and is identified by a single
               value of atmVpCrossConnectIndex.

            Negotiated VP Cross-Connect Establishment

          (2a) The manager creates a row in this table by
               setting atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus to
               createAndWait(5).  The agent checks the
               requested topology and the mutual sanity of
               the ATM traffic parameters and
               service categories, i.e., the row creation
               fails if:
               - the requested topology is incompatible with
                 associated values of atmVplCastType,
               - the requested topology is not supported
                 by the agent,
               - the traffic/service category parameter values
                 associated with the requested row are
                 incompatible with those of already existing
                 rows for this VP cross-connect.
               [For example, for setting up
               a point-to-point VP cross-connect, the
               ATM traffic parameters in the receive direction


               of a VPL at the low end of the cross-connect
               must equal to the traffic parameters in the
               transmit direction of the other VPL at the
               high end of the cross-connect,
               otherwise, the row creation fails.]
               The agent also checks for internal errors
               in building the cross-connect.

               The atmVpCrossConnectIndex values in the
               corresponding atmVplTable rows are filled
               in by the agent at this point.

          (2b) The manager promotes the row in the
               atmVpCrossConnectTable by setting
               atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus to active(1).  If
               this set is successful, the agent has reserved
               the resources specified by the ATM traffic
               parameter and Service category values
               for each direction of the VP cross-connect
               in an ATM switch or network.

           (3) The manager sets the
               atmVpCrossConnectAdminStatus to up(1) in all
               rows of this VP cross-connect to turn the
               traffic flow on.

            One-Shot VP Cross-Connect Establishment

            A VP cross-connect may also be established in
            one step by a set-request with all necessary
            parameter values and atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus
            set to createAndGo(4).

            In contrast to the negotiated VP cross-connect
            establishment which allows for detailed error
            checking (i.e., set errors are explicitly linked
            to particular resource acquisition failures),
            the one-shot VP cross-connect establishment
            performs the setup on one operation but does not
            have the advantage of step-wise error checking.

            VP Cross-Connect Retirement

            A VP cross-connect identified by a particular
            value of atmVpCrossConnectIndex is released by:

           (1) Setting atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus of all


               rows identified by this value of
               atmVpCrossConnectIndex to destroy(6).
               The agent may release all
               associated resources, and the
               atmVpCrossConnectIndex values in the
               corresponding atmVplTable row are removed.
               Note that a situation when only a subset of
               the associated rows are deleted corresponds
               to a VP topology change.

           (2) After deletion of the appropriate
               atmVpCrossConnectEntries, the manager may
               set atmVplRowStatus to destroy(6) the
               associated VPLs.  The agent releases
               the resources and removes the associated
               rows in the atmVplTable.

            VP Cross-connect Reconfiguration

            At the discretion of the agent, a VP
            cross-connect may be reconfigured by
            adding and/or deleting leafs to/from
            the VP topology as per the VP cross-connect
            establishment/retirement procedures.
            Reconfiguration of traffic/service category parameter
            values requires release of the VP cross-connect
            before those parameter values may by changed
            for individual VPLs."

               the associated rows are deleted corresponds


               to a VC topology change.

           (2) After deletion of the appropriate
               atmVcCrossConnectEntries, the manager may
               set atmVclRowStatus to destroy(6) the
               associated VCLs.  The agent releases
               the resources and removes the associated
               rows in the atmVclTable.

            VC Cross-Connect Reconfiguration

            At the discretion of the agent, a VC
            cross-connect may be reconfigured by
            adding and/or deleting leafs to/from
            the VC topology as per the VC cross-connect
            establishment/retirement procedures.
            Reconfiguration of traffic/service category parameter
            values requires release of the VC cross-connect
            before those parameter values may by changed
            for individual VCLs."

    DESCRIPTION
         "The MIB module to describe
         SONET/SDH interfaces objects."


    REVISION      "9810190000Z"
    DESCRIPTION
        "The key changes made to this MIB module
        since its initial publication in RFC 1595
        are as follows.

        (1) The MODULE-IDENTITY has been updated to reflect the
            changes to the MIB.

        (2) Where applicable, the textual conventions
            PerfCurrentCount and PerfIntervalCount from
            PerfHist-TC-MIB have been used in place of Gauge32.

        (3) An agent now has the option to delay updates to
            the various performance counts in lieu of performing
            retroactive adjustments upon entering into or exiting
            from unavailable time. This implementation option is
            described in Appendix A of this memo.

        (4) In order to make the SONET-MIB more useful for
            circuit provisioning, the formerly read-only objects
            sonetMediumType, sonetMediumLineCoding,
            sonetMediumLineType, and sonetMediumCircuitIdentifier
            have been given a MAX-ACCESS of read-write. The
            MIN-ACCESS remains read-only.

        (5) The DESCRIPTION clause for sonetMediumTimeElapsed has
            been updated to describe its behaviour if the duration
            of the current interval exceeds the maximum value.

        (6) The DESCRIPTION clause for sonetMediumValidIntervals
            has been updated to describe its behaviour when some
            intervals may be unavailable, and the object
            sonetMediumInvalidIntervals has been added to keep
            count of the number of missing intervals (if any).

        (7) The object sonetMediumLoopbackConfig has been added
            to enable or disable loopback configurations.

        (8) Because the error count thresholds for declaring
            severely errored seconds that are specified in ANSI
            T1.231-1993, ITU-T G.826-1995, and ANSI T1.231-1997
            are all different from each other and from the thresholds
            specified in RFC 1595, an enumerated INTEGER object
            sonetSESthresholdSet has been added to allow an agent
            to specify which threshold set is in use. Text has
            been added to Section 3 stating that if this object is
            not implemented the thresholds specified in RFC 1595


            should be assumed, and the table containing those
            thresholds has been moved to Appendix B of this memo.

        (9) A column with SYNTAX TruthValue has been added to each
            interval table.  The purpose of the additional column
            is to indicate, for each interval, whether the data
            is valid in the sense intended by ANSI T1.231 clause
            9.1.2.2 [31][35]. The objects in question are:

                sonetSectionIntervalValidData
                sonetLineIntervalValidData
                sonetFarEndLineIntervalValidData
                sonetPathIntervalValidData
                sonetFarEndPathIntervalValidData
                sonetVTIntervalValidData
                sonetFarEndVTIntervalValidData

       (10) The ranges for sonetPathCurrentStatus and
            sonetVTCurrentStatus have been made consistent
            with the DESCRIPTION clauses.

       (11) The conformance information has been updated. Previous
            conformance information from RFC 1595 has been
            deprecated. Some typographical errors in the deprecated
            section have been corrected in order to prevent

                      support setting the value of this object to some
                      of the enumerated values.

                      The value other(1) is returned if the MAU is in
                      a state other than one of the states 2 through
                      6.


                      The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
                      true state is unknown; for example, when it is
                      being initialized.

                      A MAU in the operational(3) state is fully
                      functional, operates, and passes signals to its
                      attached DTE or repeater port in accordance to
                      its specification.

                      A MAU in standby(4) state forces DI and CI to
                      idle and the media transmitter to idle or fault,
                      if supported.  Standby(4) mode only applies to
                      link type MAUs.  The state of
                      rpMauMediaAvailable is unaffected.

                      A MAU in shutdown(5) state assumes the same
                      condition on DI, CI, and the media transmitter
                      as though it were powered down or not connected.
                      The MAU MAY return other(1) value for the
                      rpMauJabberState and rpMauMediaAvailable objects
                      when it is in this state.  For an AUI, this
                      state will remove power from the AUI.

                      Setting this variable to the value reset(6)
                      resets the MAU in the same manner as a
                      power-off, power-on cycle of at least one-half
                      second would.  The agent is not required to
                      return the value reset (6).

                      Setting this variable to the value
                      operational(3), standby(4), or shutdown(5)
                      causes the MAU to assume the respective state
                      except that setting a mixing-type MAU or an AUI
                      to standby(4) will cause the MAU to enter the
                      shutdown state."

          DESCRIPTION "If the MAU is a link or fiber type (FOIRL,
                      10BASE-T, 10BASE-F) then this is equivalent to
                      the link test fail state/low light function.
                      For an AUI or a coax (including broadband) MAU
                      this indicates whether or not loopback is
                      detected on the DI circuit.  The value of this
                      attribute persists between packets for MAU types
                      AUI, 10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BROAD36, and 10BASE-FP.

                      The value other(1) is returned if the
                      mediaAvailable state is not one of 2 through 11.

                      The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
                      true state is unknown; for example, when it is
                      being initialized.  At power-up or following a
                      reset, the value of this attribute will be
                      unknown for AUI, coax, and 10BASE-FP MAUs.  For
                      these MAUs loopback will be tested on each
                      transmission during which no collision is
                      detected.  If DI is receiving input when DO
                      returns to IDL after a transmission and there
                      has been no collision during the transmission
                      then loopback will be detected.  The value of
                      this attribute will only change during
                      non-collided transmissions for AUI, coax, and
                      10BASE-FP MAUs.

                      For 100Mbps and 1000Mbps MAUs, the enumerations
                      match the states within the respective link
                      integrity state diagrams, fig 32-16, 23-12 and
                      24-15 of sections 32, 23 and 24 of [16].  Any
                      MAU which implements management of
                      auto-negotiation will map remote fault
                      indication to remote fault.

                      The value available(3) indicates that the link,
                      light, or loopback is normal.  The value
                      notAvailable(4) indicates link loss, low light,
                      or no loopback.


                      The value remoteFault(5) indicates that a fault
                      has been detected at the remote end of the link.
                      This value applies to 10BASE-FB, 100BASE-T4 Far
                      End Fault Indication and non-specified remote
                      faults from a system running auto-negotiation.
                      The values remoteJabber(7), remoteLinkLoss(8),
                      and remoteTest(9) SHOULD be used instead of
                      remoteFault(5) where the reason for remote fault
                      is identified in the remote signaling protocol.

                      The value invalidSignal(6) indicates that an
                      invalid signal has been received from the other
                      end of the link.  InvalidSignal(6) applies only
                      to MAUs of type 10BASE-FB.

                      Where an IEEE Std 802.3u-1995 clause 22 MII
                      is present, a logic one in the remote fault bit
                      (reference section 22.2.4.2.8 of that document)
                      maps to the value remoteFault(5), and a logic
                      zero in the link status bit (reference section
                      22.2.4.2.10 of that document) maps to the value
                      notAvailable(4).  The value notAvailable(4)
                      takes precedence over the value remoteFault(5).

                      Any MAU that implements management of clause 37
                      Auto-Negotiation will map the received Remote
                      Fault (RF1 and RF2) bit values for Offline to
                      offline(10), Link Failure to remoteFault(5) and
                      Auto-Negotiation Error to autoNegError(11)."

                      A MAU in the operational(3) state is fully

                      its specification.

                      A MAU in standby(4) state forces DI and CI to
                      idle and the media transmitter to idle or fault,

                      A MAU in shutdown(5) state assumes the same
                      condition on DI, CI, and the media transmitter
                      as though it were powered down or not connected.

                      causes the MAU to assume the respective state

          DESCRIPTION "If the MAU is a link or fiber type (FOIRL,
                      10BASE-T, 10BASE-F) then this is equivalent to
                      the link test fail state/low light function.
                      For an AUI or a coax (including broadband) MAU
                      this indicates whether or not loopback is
                      detected on the DI circuit.  The value of this
                      attribute persists between packets for MAU types
                      AUI, 10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BROAD36, and 10BASE-FP.

                      The value other(1) is returned if the
                      mediaAvailable state is not one of 2 through 11.

                      The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
                      true state is unknown; for example, when it is
                      being initialized.  At power-up or following a
                      reset, the value of this attribute will be
                      unknown for AUI, coax, and 10BASE-FP MAUs.  For
                      these MAUs loopback will be tested on each
                      transmission during which no collision is
                      detected.  If DI is receiving input when DO
                      returns to IDL after a transmission and there
                      has been no collision during the transmission
                      then loopback will be detected.  The value of
                      this attribute will only change during
                      non-collided transmissions for AUI, coax, and
                      10BASE-FP MAUs.

                      For 100Mbps and 1000Mbps MAUs, the enumerations
                      match the states within the respective link
                      integrity state diagrams, fig 32-16, 23-12 and
                      24-15 of sections 32, 23 and 24 of [16].  Any
                      MAU which implements management of
                      auto-negotiation will map remote fault
                      indication to remote fault.

                      The value available(3) indicates that the link,
                      light, or loopback is normal.  The value
                      notAvailable(4) indicates link loss, low light,
                      or no loopback.

                      The value remoteFault(5) indicates that a fault
                      has been detected at the remote end of the link.
                      This value applies to 10BASE-FB, 100BASE-T4 Far
                      End Fault Indication and non-specified remote
                      faults from a system running auto-negotiation.


                      The values remoteJabber(7), remoteLinkLoss(8),
                      and remoteTest(9) SHOULD be used instead of
                      remoteFault(5) where the reason for remote fault
                      is identified in the remote signaling protocol.

                      The value invalidSignal(6) indicates that an
                      invalid signal has been received from the other
                      end of the link.  InvalidSignal(6) applies only
                      to MAUs of type 10BASE-FB.

                      Where an IEEE Std 802.3u-1995 clause 22 MII
                      is present, a logic one in the remote fault bit
                      (reference section 22.2.4.2.8 of that document)
                      maps to the value remoteFault(5), and a logic
                      zero in the link status bit (reference section
                      22.2.4.2.10 of that document) maps to the value
                      notAvailable(4).  The value notAvailable(4)
                      takes precedence over the value remoteFault(5).

                      Any MAU that implements management of clause 37
                      Auto-Negotiation will map the received RF1 and

                      A value that uniquely identifies the set of
                      possible IEEE 802.3 types that the MAU could be.
                      The value is a sum which initially takes the
                      value zero.  Then, for each type capability of
                      this MAU, 2 raised to the power noted below is
                      added to the sum. For example, a MAU which has
                      the capability to be only 10BASE-T would have a
                      value of 512 (2**9).  In contrast, a MAU which
                      supports both 10Base-T (full duplex) and
                      100BASE-TX (full duplex) would have a value of
                      ((2**11) + (2**16)) or 67584.

                      conjunction with the operational MAU type
                      denoted by ifMauType.

                      The set of possible values for this object is
                      the same as the set defined for the ifMauType
                      object.

                      This object represents the
                      administratively-configured type of the MAU.  If
                      auto-negotiation is not enabled or is not
                      implemented for this MAU, the value of this
                      object determines the operational type of the
                      MAU.  In this case, a set to this object will
                      force the MAU into the specified operating mode.

                      If auto-negotiation is implemented and enabled
                      for this MAU, the operational type of the MAU
                      is determined by auto-negotiation, and the value
                      of this object denotes the type to which the MAU
                      will automatically revert if/when
                      auto-negotiation is later disabled.

                      NOTE TO IMPLEMENTORS:  It may be necessary to


                      provide for underlying hardware implementations
                      which do not follow the exact behavior specified

                      ifMauAutoNegAdminStatus transitions from enabled
                      to disabled, the agent implementation MUST

    SYNTAX INTEGER (1..2147483647)

PhysicalClass ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS            current
    DESCRIPTION
            "An enumerated value which provides an indication of the
            general hardware type of a particular physical entity.
            There are no restrictions as to the number of
            entPhysicalEntries of each entPhysicalClass, which must be
            instantiated by an agent.

            The enumeration 'other' is applicable if the physical entity
            class is known, but does not match any of the supported
            values.

            The enumeration 'unknown' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is unknown to the agent.

            The enumeration 'chassis' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is an overall container for networking
            equipment.  Any class of physical entity except a stack may
            be contained within a chassis, and a chassis may only be
            contained within a stack.

            The enumeration 'backplane' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is some sort of device for aggregating and
            forwarding networking traffic, such as a shared backplane in
            a modular ethernet switch.  Note that an agent may model a


            backplane as a single physical entity, which is actually
            implemented as multiple discrete physical components (within
            a chassis or stack).

            The enumeration 'container' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is capable of containing one or more removable
            physical entities, possibly of different types. For example,
            each (empty or full) slot in a chassis will be modeled as a
            container. Note that all removable physical entities should
            be modeled within a container entity, such as field-
            replaceable modules, fans, or power supplies.  Note that all
            known containers should be modeled by the agent, including
            empty containers.

            The enumeration 'powerSupply' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is a power-supplying component.

            The enumeration 'fan' is applicable if the physical entity
            class is a fan or other heat-reduction component.

            The enumeration 'sensor' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is some sort of sensor, such as a temperature
            sensor within a router chassis.

            The enumeration 'module' is applicable if the physical
            entity class is some sort of self-contained sub-system.  If
            it is removable, then it should be modeled within a
            container entity, otherwise it should be modeled directly
            within another physical entity (e.g., a chassis or another
            module).

            The enumeration 'port' is applicable if the physical entity
            class is some sort of networking port, capable of receiving
            and/or transmitting networking traffic.

            The enumeration 'stack' is applicable if the physical entity
            class is some sort of super-container (possibly virtual),
            intended to group together multiple chassis entities.  A
            stack may be realized by a 'virtual' cable, a real
            interconnect cable, attached to multiple chassis, or may in
            fact be comprised of multiple interconnect cables. A stack
            should not be modeled within any other physical entities,
            but a stack may be contained within another stack.  Only
            chassis entities should be contained within a stack."

    DESCRIPTION
            "An indication of the relative position of this 'child'
            component among all its 'sibling' components. Sibling
            components are defined as entPhysicalEntries which share the
            same instance values of each of the entPhysicalContainedIn
            and entPhysicalClass objects.

            An NMS can use this object to identify the relative ordering
            for all sibling components of a particular parent
            (identified by the entPhysicalContainedIn instance in each
            sibling entry).

            This value should match any external labeling of the
            physical component if possible. For example, for a container
            (e.g., card slot) labeled as 'slot #3',
            entPhysicalParentRelPos should have the value '3'.  Note
            that the entPhysicalEntry for the module plugged in slot 3
            should have an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '1'.

            If the physical position of this component does not match
            any external numbering or clearly visible ordering, then
            user documentation or other external reference material
            should be used to determine the parent-relative position. If
            this is not possible, then the the agent should assign a
            consistent (but possibly arbitrary) ordering to a given set
            of 'sibling' components, perhaps based on internal
            representation of the components.

            If the agent cannot determine the parent-relative position
            for some reason, or if the associated value of
            entPhysicalContainedIn is '0', then the value '-1' is
            returned. Otherwise a non-negative integer is returned,
            indicating the parent-relative position of this physical
            entity.

            Parent-relative ordering normally starts from '1' and
            continues to 'N', where 'N' represents the highest

            of the same parent component.

            known by this agent, there are zero or more mappings to the
            physical resources which are used to realize that logical
            entity.

            An agent should limit the number and nature of entries in
            this table such that only meaningful and non-redundant
            information is returned. For example, in a system which
            contains a single power supply, mappings between logical
            entities and the power supply are not useful and should not
            be included.

            Also, only the most appropriate physical component which is
            closest to the root of a particular containment tree should
            be identified in an entLPMapping entry.

            For example, suppose a bridge is realized on a particular
            module, and all ports on that module are ports on this
            bridge. A mapping between the bridge and the module would be
            useful, but additional mappings between the bridge and each
            of the ports on that module would be redundant (since the
            entPhysicalContainedIn hierarchy can provide the same
            information). If, on the other hand, more than one bridge
            was utilizing ports on this module, then mappings between
            each bridge and the ports it used would be appropriate.

            Also, in the case of a single backplane repeater, a mapping
            for the backplane to the single repeater entity is not
            necessary."

            If this object has a non-zero value, then it identifies the
            logical entity named by the same value of entLogicalIndex.

            the physical component and the alias identifier for this
            entAliasMapping entry is associated with all unspecified
            logical entities. That is, a value of zero (the default

            an explicit entry in this table for a particular
            entPhysicalIndex/entAliasMappingIdentifier pair.

            For example, to indicate that a particular interface (e.g.,
            physical component 33) is identified by the same value of
            ifIndex for all logical entities, the following instance
            might exist:

                    entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.0 = ifIndex.5

            In the event an entPhysicalEntry is associated differently

            this example, all logical entities except 4, 5, and 10,
            associate physical entity 33 with ifIndex.6."

            Since only physical ports are modeled in this table, only
            entries which represent interfaces or ports are allowed.  If
            an ifEntry exists on behalf of a particular physical port,
            then this object should identify the associated 'ifEntry'.
            For repeater ports, the appropriate row in the
            'rptrPortGroupTable' should be identified instead.

            For example, suppose a physical port was represented by
            entPhysicalEntry.3, entLogicalEntry.15 existed for a
            repeater, and entLogicalEntry.22 existed for a bridge.  Then

               entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.22 == ifIndex.17
            It is possible that other mappings (besides interfaces and
            repeater ports) may be defined in the future, as required.

            Bridge ports are identified by examining the Bridge MIB and
            appropriate ifEntries associated with each 'dot1dBasePort',

            An agent should not generate more than one entConfigChange

            objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent
            to test an interface for various faults.  Tests for an
            interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that
            interface.  After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult
            can be read to determine the outcome.  If an agent can not
            perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate.  The
            object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test-
            specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific)
            information concerning the outcome of the test.  Only one
            test can be in progress on each interface at any one time.
            If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the
            second test is rejected.  Some agents may reject a test when
            a prior test is active on another interface.

              when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult
                   agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse'

              retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId

              if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid

            A manager station first retrieves the value of the
            appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically
            repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of
            ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'.  The manager station then tries
            to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just
            retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the
            corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating
            itself.  If the set operation succeeds then the manager has
            obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the
            ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the
            semantics of TestAndIncr).  Failure of the set operation
            indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of
            the ifTestEntry.

            Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be
            setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType.
            On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to
            'notInUse'.  Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the
            results.  In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests
            by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be
            a possibility that the first test's results might be
            overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first


            results being read.  This unlikely circumstance can be
            detected by a network manager retrieving ifTestId at the
            same time as retrieving the test results, and ensuring that
            the results are for the desired request.

            If ifTestType is not set within an abnormally long period of
            time after ownership is obtained, the agent should time-out
            the manager, and reset the value of the ifTestStatus object
            back to 'notInUse'.  It is suggested that this time-out
            period be 5 minutes.

            In general, a management station must not retransmit a
            request to invoke a test for which it does not receive a
            response; instead, it properly inspects an agent's MIB to
            determine if the invocation was successful.  Only if the
            invocation was unsuccessful, is the invocation request
            retransmitted.

            Some tests may require the interface to be taken off-line in
            order to execute them, or may even require the agent to
            reboot after completion of the test.  In these
            circumstances, communication with the management station
            invoking the test may be lost until after completion of the
            test.  An agent is not required to support such tests.
            However, if such tests are supported, then the agent should
            make every effort to transmit a response to the request
            which invoked the test prior to losing communication.  When
            the agent is restored to normal service, the results of the
            test are properly made available in the appropriate objects.
            Note that this requires that the ifIndex value assigned to
            an interface must be unchanged even if the test causes a
            reboot.  An agent must reject any test for which it cannot,
            perhaps due to resource constraints, make available at least
            the minimum amount of information after that test
            completes."

          value of ifStackLowerLayer.  (If z is not involved in
          multiplexing, then these are the only two rows associated

          "The status of the relationship between two sub-layers.

          An instance of this object exists for each instance of the
          ifStackStatus object, and vice versa.  For example, if the
          variable ifStackStatus.H.L exists, then the variable
          ifInvStackStatus.L.H must also exist, and vice versa.  In
          addition, the two variables always have the same value.

          However, unlike ifStackStatus, the ifInvStackStatus object
          is NOT write-able.  A network management application wishing
          to change a relationship between sub-layers H and L cannot
          do so by modifying the value of ifInvStackStatus.L.H, but
          must instead modify the value of ifStackStatus.H.L.  After
          the ifStackTable is modified, the change will be reflected
          in this table."

DESCRIPTION
     "This MIB module defines a collection of objects for managing
      HDSL2/SHDSL lines.  An agent may reside at either end of the
      line, however the MIB is designed to require no management
      communication between the modems beyond that inherent in the
      low-level EOC line protocol as defined in ANSI T1E1.4/2000-006
      (for HDSL2 lines), or in ITU G.991.2 (for SHDSL lines)."

Hdsl2ShdslPerfCurrDayCount ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
   STATUS    current
   DESCRIPTION
     "A gauge associated with interface performance measurements in
      a current 1-day (24 hour) measurement interval.

      The value of this gauge starts at zero at the beginning of an
      interval and is increased when associated events occur, until
      the end of the 1-day interval.  At that time the value of the
      gauge is stored in the previous 1-day history interval, as
      defined in a companion object of type


      Hdsl2Shdsl1DayIntevalCount, and the current interval gauge
      is restarted at zero.

      In the case where the agent has no valid data available for
      this interval the corresponding object instance is not
      available and upon a retrieval request a corresponding error
      message shall be returned to indicate that this instance does
      not exist.  Please note that zero is a valid value."

Hdsl2Shdsl1DayIntervalCount ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
   STATUS    current
   DESCRIPTION
     "A counter associated with interface performance measurements
      during the most previous 1-day (24 hour) measurement interval.
      The value of this gauge is equal to the value of the current
      day gauge, as defined in a companion object of type
      Hdsl2ShdslPerfCurrDayCount, at the end of its most recent
      interval.

      In the case where the agent has no valid data available for
      this interval the corresponding object instance is not
      available and upon a retrieval request a corresponding error
      message shall be returned to indicate that this instance does

      an adjustment in the system's time-of-day clock or the addition
      of a leap second, the current interval exceeds the maximum
      value, the agent will return the maximum value.

      For 15 minute intervals, the range is limited to (0..899).
      For 24 hour intervals, the range is limited to (0..86399)."

    DESCRIPTION
            "An object using this data type represents a sensor
            precision range.

            An object of this type SHOULD be defined together with
            objects of type EntitySensorDataType and
            EntitySensorDataScale.  Together, associated objects of
            these three types are used to identify the semantics of an
            object of type EntitySensorValue.

            If an object of this type contains a value in the range 1 to
            9, it represents the number of decimal places in the
            fractional part of an associated EntitySensorValue fixed-
            point number.

            If an object of this type contains a value in the range -8
            to -1, it represents the number of accurate digits in the
            associated EntitySensorValue fixed-point number.

            The value zero indicates the associated EntitySensorValue
            object is not a fixed-point number.

            Agent implementors must choose a value for the associated
            EntitySensorPrecision object so that the precision and


            accuracy of the associated EntitySensorValue object is
            correctly indicated.

            For example, a physical entity representing a temperature
            sensor that can measure 0 degrees to 100 degrees C in 0.1
            degree increments, +/- 0.05 degrees, would have an
            EntitySensorPrecision value of '1', an EntitySensorDataScale
            value of 'units(9)', and an EntitySensorValue ranging from
            '0' to '1000'.  The EntitySensorValue would be interpreted
            as 'degrees C * 10'."

         This value should be returned by a read request when no switch
         command has been written to the object in question since
         initialization. This value may not be used in a write
         operation.  If noCmd is used in a write operation a wrongValue
         error is returned.


         clear

         Clears all of the switch commands listed below for the
         specified channel.

         lockoutOfProtection

         Prevents any of the working channels from switching to the
         protection line. The specified channel should be the protection
         channel, otherwise an inconsistentValue error is returned.

         forcedSwitchWorkToProtect

         Switches the specified working channel to the protection line.
         If the protection channel is specified an inconsistentValue
         error is returned.

         forcedSwitchProtectToWork

         Switches the working channel back from the protection

                 "This table is deprecated in favour of using


                 ifStackTable.

                 Implementation of this table was optional.  It was
                 designed for those systems dividing a DS3/E3 into
                 channels containing different data streams that
                 are of local interest.

                 The DS3/E3 fractional table identifies which
                 DS3/E3 channels associated with a CSU are being
                 used to support a logical interface, i.e., an
                 entry in the interfaces table from the Internet-
                 standard MIB.

                 For example, consider a DS3 device with 4 high
                 speed links carrying router traffic, a feed for
                 voice, a feed for video, and a synchronous channel
                 for a non-routed protocol.  We might describe the
                 allocation of channels, in the dsx3FracTable, as
                 follows:

      DESCRIPTION
        "The imaGroupRowStatus object allows create, change, and delete
        operations on imaGroupTable entries.

        To create a new conceptual row (or instance) of the imaGroupTable,
        imaGroupRowStatus must be set to 'createAndWait' or 'createAndGo'.
        If settable, a successful set of the following objects must be
        performed before the imaGroupRowStatus of a new conceptual row can
        be set to 'active':

          imaGroupMinNumTxLinks
          imaGroupMinNumRxLinks
          imaGroupTxImaId

        Some objects in the imaGroupTable control settings which can only
        be established or changed at group start-up time.  These objects
        include:

          imaGroupTxImaId
          imaGroupSymmetry
          imaGroupTxFrameLength

        To change (modify) the imaGroupTxImaId object, the manager must
        first set imaGroupRowStatus to 'notInService'.  However, changes
        to the following two objects can be optionally allowed while the
        imaGroupRowStatus is 'active':

          imaGroupSymmetry
          imaGroupTxFrameLength

        These two objects can be changed when the imaGroupRowStatus is
        'active' in order to allow the far-end to recover from its
        Config-Aborted state without having to force the near-end Group
        State machine to go to the 'Not Configured' state.  Changing
        these object values after group start-up has completed causes a
        restart of the IMA group.

        Alternatively, as noted above, the agent implementation may
        simply require the imaGroupRowStatus object to first be set to
        'notInService' before allowing changes to either of these two
        objects.

        To remove (delete) an imaGroupTable entry from this table, set
        imaGroupRowStatus to 'destroy'.

        Setting the imaGroupRowStatus to 'active' has the effect of
        activating the Group Startup Procedure.  The Group Startup
        Procedure uses provisioned links that have imaLinkRowStatus set
        to 'active' and imaLinkGroupIndex set to the imaGroupIndex in
        this conceptual row.

        When the imaGroupRowStatus is not in 'active' state, the Group
        State machine is in its 'Not Configured' state."

        the association between a physical IMA link and the IMA group to
        which it belongs, and setting the imaLinkGroupIndex object to a

DomainName ::=  TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       STATUS  current
       DESCRIPTION
            "The domain name space is a tree structure.  Each node and 
            leaf on the tree corresponds to a resource set (which may be 
            empty).  The domain system makes no distinctions between the 
            uses of the interior nodes and leaves, and this memo uses the 
            term 'node' to refer to both. Each node has a label, which is 
            zero to 63 octets in length.  Brother nodes may not have the 
            same label, although the same label can be used for nodes 
            which are not brothers.  One label is reserved, and that is
            the null (i.e., zero length) label used for the root.
            The domain name of a node is the list of the labels on the 
            path from the node to the root of the tree.  By convention, 
            the labels that compose a domain name are printed or read 
            left to right, from the most specific (lowest, farthest from 
            the root) to the least specific (highest, closest to the 
            root).
 
            Internally, programs that manipulate domain names should 
            represent them as sequences of labels, where each label is a 
            length octet followed by  an octet string.  Because all domain 
            names end at the root, which has a null string for a label, 
            these internal representations can use a length byte of zero 
            to terminate a domain name.
 
            By convention, domain names can be stored with arbitrary case, but
            domain name comparisons for all present domain functions are done in 
            a case-insensitive manner, assuming an ASCII character set, and a 
            high order zero bit.  This means that you are free to create a node 
            with label 'A' or a node with label 'a', but not both as brothers; 
            you could refer to either using 'a' or 'A'.  When you receive a 
            domain name or label, you should preserve its case.  The rationale 
            for this  choice is that we may someday need to add full binary 
            domain names for  new services; existing services would not be 
            changed.
 
            When a user needs to type a domain name, the length of each label is
            omitted and the labels are separated by dots ('.').  Since a complete
            domain name ends with the root label, this leads to a printed form 
            which ends in a dot.  We use this property to distinguish between:
 
            character string which represents a complete domain name
            (often called 'absolute').  For example, 'poneria.ISI.EDU.'
 
           - a character string that represents the starting labels of a
           domain name which is incomplete, and should be completed by
           local software using knowledge of the local domain (often
           called 'relative').  For example, 'poneria' used in the
           ISI.EDU domain.
 
           Relative names are either taken relative to a well known 
           origin, or to a list of domains used as a search list.  Relative 
           names appear mostly at the user interface, where their interpretation 
           varies  from implementation to implementation, and in master files, 
           where they  are  relative to a single origin domain name.  The most 
           common interpretation uses the root '.' as either the single origin 
           or as one of the members of the search list, so a multi-label relative 
           name is often one where the trailing dot has been omitted to save 
           typing.
 
           To simplify implementations, the total number of octets that represent  a
           domain name (i.e., the sum of all label octets and label lengths) is
           limited to 255.
 
           A domain is identified by a domain name, and consists of that part of
           the domain name space that is at or below the domain name which
           specifies the domain.  A domain is a subdomain of another domain if it
           is contained within that domain.  This relationship can be tested by
           seeing if the subdomain's name ends with the containing domain's name.
           For example, A.B.C.D is a subdomain of B.C.D, C.D, D, and  '.' "

   SnmpAdminString ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
        DISPLAY-HINT "255a"
        STATUS       current
        DESCRIPTION "An octet string containing administrative
           information, preferably in human-readable form.
 
           To facilitate internationalization, this
           information is represented using the ISO/IEC
           IS 10646-1 character set, encoded as an octet
           string using the UTF-8 transformation format
           described in [RFC2044].
 
           Since additional code points are added by
           amendments to the 10646 standard from time
           to time, implementations must be prepared to
           encounter any code point from 0x00000000 to
           0x7fffffff.
 
           The use of control codes should be avoided.
 
           When it is necessary to represent a newline,
           the control code sequence CR LF should be used.
 
 
           The use of leading or trailing white space should
           be avoided.
 
           For code points not directly supported by user
           interface hardware or software, an alternative
           means of entry and display, such as hexadecimal,
           may be provided.
 
           For information encoded in 7-bit US-ASCII,
           the UTF-8 encoding is identical to the
           US-ASCII encoding.
 
           Note that when this TC is used for an object that
           is used or envisioned to be used as an index, then
           a SIZE restriction must be specified so that the
           number of sub-identifiers for any object instance
           does not exceed the limit of 128, as defined by
           [RFC1905].

--
--    The  HotWire Diagnostics MIB
--
--    This MIB provides an NMS to trigger a diagnostic test 
--    The tests that can be performed are grouped into the following
--    categories :
--       1. Device Tests ( Self, Test Reset ...) 
--       2. interface related tests (bert test, packet loopback ...)
--       3. application based diagnostic tests (Ping, TraceRoute ...)
--
--    Interface related tests (2) are an exception. An NMS will use
--    the ifTestTable of RFC1573 to start these tests. However if any 
--    of the interface related tests need to have inputs. those tests
--    will use the objects defined under the ifTestInput group.
--    Hence in these cases implementation of the following groups
--    are mandatory.
--       ifDeviceInput
--       ifDeviceResults - This group is mandatory if more specific 
--                         information about the results is required
--                         (other than ifTestResult - RFC 1573,ifTestTable) 
--                         to be sent back to an NMS.
--                         Hence in these cases it is left to the 
--                         implementor of the device to put
--                         the OID of the object or results table
--                         containing such specifics to be put
--                         in ifTestCode (RFC 1573, ifTestTable).
--       Note  that the above mentioned groups compliment the ifTestTable
--       of RFC 1573
--
--    if the device supports device tests (1), the devControl.mib needs
--    to be implemented. In addition the following group needs to be 
--    implemented 
--       deviceTestInput
--       deviceTestResults
--
--    if the device supports application tests (1). implementation of the
--    following groups are mandatory.
--       applTests
--

-- History
--
-- 05/02/2000
--
-- Removed integer ranges as those should be designated in the
-- product documentation
--
-- 06/07/2000
--
-- Corrected spelling errors in Probe1,2,3, etc.
--
-- 10/04/2001
--
-- Added a new Interface test called BLERT (Block Error Rate Test)
-- which is intended for MVL.

-- Device Traps Manager,  01/30/97 
--
-- This MIB will allow an SNMP Manager the ability to edit the Trap Manager
-- table on a Paradyne device. It provides a mechanism to add, delete or edit
-- trap manager entries.
--
-- ===============================================================

        object is set to the default value of read (1).
        If the index for this object is not in the existing table and if there
        is room in the table then the index will be used to create a new

                  In addition changing an existing access permission to noAccess
                  invalidates the corresponding row of this table. It is upto
                  the implementation to decide whether to actually remove this

-- Configuration Change Keys Table
--
-- This table contains a set of keys specific to each non-volatile

-- there is a change to the database that they represent.
--
-- Example of Use:
--
--   1) Database Discovery
--      This MIB can be used to discover the various non-volatile
--      databases on a device.  Each database has a unique key.
--
--      The discovery process consists of walking devConfigChangeKeysDbKey.
--      Each response corresponds to a different database type.  The NMS
--      only needs to be concerned with the databases that affect them.
--      Each of the "interesting" database keys should be stored for later
--      reference.
--
--   2) Database monitoring
--         After discovery, the NMS can check the database keys of the
--         databases of interest to it either at specific intervals or
--         based on configuration change traps.  When using trap directed,
--         polling, a default polling interval should still apply in case
--         a trap is lost in the transmission process.
--         
--         Checking the keys consists of performing a get operation on
--         devConfigChangeKeysDbKey for the specific database(s) of interest.  
--         If the key has changed from that previously stored, the database
--         has changed.  The new key should be stored for future reference.

       " Use of the File Tranfer MIB could be used with other MIBS in
              the following manner:
                  a) Use another MIB/means to verify available space /make room
                     for a file to be transfered to this device
                  b) Use this MIB to download the file
                  c) Use another MIB/means to select the file you want to make 
                     active
                                        if your selecting firmware for example.
                  d) Use another MIB/means to reset the device.

        A management station wishing to initiate a file transfer needs to
                         create an entry in this table. To do so, you must
       first identify the ifIndex of the device you intend to
       do the transfer with.  You should
       then create the associated instance of the row status
       It must also, either in the same
       or in successive PDUs, create an instance of
       devFileXferFileName, DevFileXferFileType, 
.      devFileXferServerIpAddress,
       devFileXferOperation.

       It should also modify the default values for the other
       configuration objects if the defaults are not appropriate.

       Once the appropriate instance of all the configuration
       objects have been created, either by an explicit SNMP
       set request or by default, the row status should be set
       to active to initiate the request. Note that this entire
       procedure may be initiated via a single set request which
       specifies a row status of createAndGo as well as specifies
       valid values for the non-defaulted configuration objects.

       Once the DevFileXferConfigEntry request has been created (i.e. the
       devFileXferRowStatus has been made active), the entry
       cannot be modified - the only operation possible
       after this is to delete the row.

       Once the request completes, the management station should
       retrieve the values of the status objects of interest, and
       should then delete the entry.  In order to prevent old
       entries from clogging the table, entries could be aged out,
       but an entry will never be deleted within 5 minutes of
       completing.  "

       " Use of the File Tranfer MIB could be used with other MIBS in
              the following manner:
                  a) Use another MIB/means to verify available space /make room
                     for a file to be transfered to this device
                  b) Use this MIB to download the file
                  c) Use another MIB object/means to select the file you want to make 
                     active
                                        if your selecting firmware for example.
                  d) Use another MIB/means to reset the device.

        A management station wishing to initiate a file transfer needs to
                         create an entry in this table. To do so, you must
       first identify the session id of the session that   
       the transfer is done with.  This is done by setting SessionID
       to 0 on SET and when session is establish entering that session
       id into this object. You should
       then create the associated instance of the row status
       It must also, either in the same
       or in successive PDUs, create an instance of
       pdnDevFileXferFileName, pdnDevFileXferFileType, 
.      pdnDevFileXferServerIpAddress,
       pdnDevFileXferOperation.

       It should also modify the default values for the other
       configuration objects if the defaults are not appropriate.

       Once the appropriate instance of all the configuration
       objects have been created, either by an explicit SNMP
       set request or by default, the row status should be set
       to active to initiate the request. Note that this entire
       procedure may be initiated via a single set request which
       specifies a row status of createAndGo as well as specifies
       valid values for the non-defaulted configuration objects.

       Once the request completes, the management station should
       retrieve the values of the status objects of interest, and
       should then delete the entry.  In order to prevent old
       entries from clogging the table, entries could be aged out,
       but an entry will never be deleted within 5 minutes of
       completing.  "

  DESCRIPTION
   "The mpe dslam MIB. This MIB is written specifically to
   extend entPhysicalTable." 

   REVISION "200306060000Z"  -- June 6, 2003
   DESCRIPTION "Jesus Pinto and Clay Sikes
               Removed the entPhysicalIndex as an object in the
               mpeAlarmRelayInputStateChanged notification. This
               object was redundant in that it's the instance
               part of the mpeAlarmRelayState object."

   REVISION "200304250000Z"  -- April 25, 2003
   DESCRIPTION "Jesus Pinto and Clay Sikes
               Change mpeAlarmRelayInputState to mpeAlarmRelayState
               and changed it from a read-only object to a read-
               write object. This should give ultimate flexibility."

   REVISION "200304180000Z"  -- April 18, 2003
   DESCRIPTION "Jesus Pinto and Clay Sikes
               Needed objects to read Alarm Relay Input State. The
               addition of mpeEntPhysicalExtAlarmRelayInputContactState
               below was not a good idea as it implied a dense augments.
               mpeEntPhysicalExtAlarmRelayInputContactState was deprecated.

               Added a new table, mpeAlarmRelayTable to hold alarm
               relay objects where the table implies a sparse augments.
               Deprecated mpeAlarmRrelayEquipmentIndex, 
               mpeAlarmRelayInputContactState, and the
               mpeAlarmRelayInputcontactStateChanged trap they were
               designed for to discourage use in new projects. Added a new 
               trap, mpeAlarmRelayInputStateChanged, as a replacement that
               uses objects defined in or related to the mpeAlarmRelayTable.

               The mpeAlarmRelayTable allows Alarm Relay Input state to be
               read and has a direct relationship with the objects defined
               for the mpeAlarmRelayInputStateChanged trap. Since this table
               is indexed the entPhysicalIndex, it is extremely flexible in 
               that it can apply to a Single Management Entity / Single 
               Logical Entity, a chassis, or what ever level of granularity 
               is desired in the implementation."

   REVISION "200303201500Z"  -- March 20, 2003
   DESCRIPTION "Added new notifications to complement the
		entConfigChange notification defined in RFC2737."

   REVISION "200303070000Z"  -- March 7, 2003
   DESCRIPTION "Added mpeEntPhysicalExtAlarmRelayInputContactState."

   REVISION "200210250000Z"  -- October 25, 2002
   DESCRIPTION "Added mpeEntPhysicalExtTable and cleaned up some
                MIB compiler warnings."

       " Use of the File Tranfer MIB could be used with other MIBS in
              the following manner:
                  a) Use another MIB/means to verify available space /make room
                     for a file to be transfered to this device
                  b) Use this MIB to download the file
                  c) Use another MIB/means to select the file you want to make 
                     active
                                        if your selecting firmware for example.
                  d) Use another MIB/means to reset the device.

        A management station wishing to initiate a file transfer needs to
                         create an entry in this table. To do so, you must
       first identify the entPhysicalIndex of the device you intend to
       do the transfer with.  You should
       then create the associated instance of the row status
       It must also, either in the same
       or in successive PDUs, create an instance of
       mpeDevFileXferFileName, mpeDevFileXferFileType, 
.      mpeDevFileXferServerIpAddress,
       mpeDevFileXferOperation.

       It should also modify the default values for the other
       configuration objects if the defaults are not appropriate.

       Once the appropriate instance of all the configuration
       objects have been created, either by an explicit SNMP
       set request or by default, the row status should be set
       to active to initiate the request. Note that this entire
       procedure may be initiated via a single set request which
       specifies a row status of createAndGo as well as specifies
       valid values for the non-defaulted configuration objects.

       Once the MpeDevFileXferConfigEntry request has been created (i.e. the
       mpeDevFileXferRowStatus has been made active), the entry
       cannot be modified - the only operation possible
       after this is to delete the row.

       Once the request completes, the management station should
       retrieve the values of the status objects of interest, and
       should then delete the entry.  In order to prevent old
       entries from clogging the table, entries could be aged out,
       but an entry will never be deleted within 5 minutes of
       completing.  "

--                     ATM PVCs for management purposes
-- 
-- Note:
-- 
--    The IP, UDP, and TCP MIB modules currently support only IPv4. These
--    three modules use the IpAddress type defined as an OCTET STRING of
--    length 4 to represent the IPv4 32-bit internet addresses.  (See RFC
--    2578, SMI for SNMPv2.)  They do not support the new 128-bit IPv6
--    internet addresses.

-- Table of Contents

--    1. Introduction
--    2. The Management IP Model
--    3. Structure of the MIB
--    4. Definitions
-- 
-- 1.  Introduction
-- 
--    The primary purpose of this document is to define MIBs for
--    configuration and management of Classical IP ports (also called
--    IP interfaces) that are used for managing a DSLAM device. Currently
--    the issues addressed are only those pertaining to managing a DSLAM
--    through IP over Ethernet and ATM PVCs only. Use and interpretation
--    of the MIBs defined in this document for managing IP over other
--    transports (eg. Frame Relay, ATM SVCs, etc) is beyond the current
--    scope of this document.
-- 
-- 2.  The Management IP Model
-- 
--    A DSLAM is considered to have one or more 'IP Ports'. These IP
--    Ports could either be standard Ethernet based IP Ports or those
--    operating over ATM PVCs (with RFC 2684 encapsulation).
-- 
--    Each IP Port is associated with an interface index (ifIndex of
--    RFC 2863), an IP address (Ipv4, IpAddress of RFC 2578), and an
--    IP Network Mask among other things. The ipAddrTable (defined in
--    RFC 2011) comes close to handling most of these parameters, but is
--    indexed on the IP address itself. Since it is our requirement that
--    the IP port exist whether an IP address has been assigned to it or
--    not (eg. a port configured to obtain the IP address through DHCP
--    or BOOTP), a new table has been defined in this document, which is
--    indexed on the interface index of the IP port itself.
-- 
--    In case of IP ports that are associated with ATM PVCs, each IP port
--    consists of one or more point-to-point PVC links. RFC 2320 has a
--    set of MIB tables defined for managing IP and ARP over ATM, but
--    they are better suited for systems that do InATMARP (RFC 2225)
--    and over SVCs. Unlike ARP in ethernet based IP systems, ATM ARP is
--    not very common and is not implemented in most networks. Hence a
--    MIB table is defined in this document to manually add, delete or
--    manage these PVCs for the sole purpose of carrying IP based
--    management traffic.
-- 
--    The management IP model used in this document could be depicted
--    in a couple of diagrams as shown below
--

--    Note : The ATM ARP Table is covered by this document in the form of
--           an Inverse ARP Table. ie. the table is indexed on the
--           &lt;atmIfIndex, atmVpi, atmVci&gt; combination.
-- 
-- 3.  Structure of the MIB
-- 
--    The MIB consists of two tables and other common object(s).
-- 
--    The first table is the IP Port Table. There is one entry per IP
--    port/interface in the system. This table contains the configuration
--    details of the port. This table is indexed on the interface index
--    of the IP port. The interface index of the IP Port may or may not
--    be represented in the ifTable of RFC2863.
-- 
--    The syntax and meaning of pdnMgmtIpPhysAddress is identical to
--    that of ifPhysAddress (defined in ifTable - RFC 2863), with the
--    following properties
--        1. pdnMgmtIpPhysAddress is writeable, in case of non-ethernet
--           type of media.
--        2. In case of ethernet type of media, pdnMgmtIpPhysAddress is
--           read-only and has the ethernet MAC address of the underlying
--           ethernet data link.
-- 
--    The second table is the ATM Inverse ARP Table. This table contains
--    one entry per ATM PVC that has been designated to carry IP
--    management traffic. This table is indexed on the user side
--    ATM ifIndex (usually one of the Uplinks), VPI &amp; VCI of the PVC.
--    Entries in this table can be dynamically created modified or
--    destroyed as required. An SNMP agent operating on this table
--    utilizes the standard ATM MIBs (RFC 2515) to create and manage
--    the PVCs. Creation of a new entry in this table could fail,
--    if the PVC is either already in use or the PVC is a data PVC.
-- 
--    Apart from the these two tables, this MIB also defines a "Default
--    Router" for the system. All management IP packets with unknown
--    routes to their destinations will be forwarded to this router for
--    further routing.

        DESCRIPTION 
              "SFP is short for Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP) Transceiver. 
              They  plug into an SFP Compaitble Port and allow for compact
              Hardware design
              SFP modules contain an EEPROM containing information about the
              part. This MIB defines objects which will allow an NMS to extract
              the information from the SFP modules in a MIB format.
              The MIB objects defined in this MIB are based on the 
              **Small Form Factor Pluggable (SFP) Transceiver MultiSource Agreement(MSA)**
              Since SFP MODULES are an extension of the port itself, the ifIndex for a
              sfp Compatible Port will be used to access information from these modules.
              The Entity MIB (RFC 2737) Should Contain Entries for Each SFP Module.
              SFP to Port to PortIfIndex can be acheived via the Entity MIB (RFC2737)"
